## Odyssey Opera

Continuing its Tudors-themed 2019/20 season, Boston-based [Odyssey Opera](/scene/companies/odyssey-opera/) presents Giovanni Pacini's [_Maria, Regina d'Inghilterra_](https://www.odysseyopera.org/2019-pacini-maria-regina-d-inghilterra/), **Nov. 1-3**. The 1842 opera tells the story of unrequited love between Queen Mary I, Scottish adventurer Riccardo Fenimoor, and Clotilde, and features two major soprano roles; Amy Shoremount-Obra takes on Mary, opposite Alisa Jordheim as Clotilde.

Pacini, a missing link of sorts among 19th-century Italian composers, wrote over 70 operas. "Beholding any of Pacini’s 70+ operas is a rare occurrence," says Gil Rose, Odyssey Opera's Artistic and General Director. A performance of Pacini’s Maria is extraordinary! We hope audiences will join Odyssey in rediscovering both this forgotten composer, and his wrongfully neglected masterpiece."

This fully staged production of [_Maria, Regina d'Inghilterra_](https://www.bostontheatrescene.com/season/maria-regina-dInghilterra/) runs November 1 and 3.

## Hibla Gerzmava at Koerner Hall

Show One Productions continues its [_Classical Stars at Koerner_](https://showoneproductions.ca/event/hibla-gerzmava-20191103/) series with a recital featuring Abkhazian soprano Hibla Gerzmava and pianist Ekaterina Ganelina, **Nov. 3_,_ 7pm**. The programme is a perfect mix for Gerzmava: Lush Russian romances, and _bel canto_ excerpts from some of her signature roles in _Anna Bolena_, _Norma_, and _La forza del destino_. [Tickets](https://www.rcmusic.com/event-calendar/show-one-presents-hibla-gerzmava) start at $46.
