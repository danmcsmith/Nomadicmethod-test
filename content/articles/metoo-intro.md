You might have spotted in your recent feed my call for stories of abuse, harassment, or assault in the opera and classical music worlds. #MeToo stories, essentially.

I got my first submission within an hour of posting; even today, my inbox sees the flow of stories. 

Catalyst in Domingo case, initial call for stories

Near-immediate flow of emails with stories about themselves and their colleagues in shitty situations

Personal stories, open secrets, "I heard" stuff about select coaches/conductors/teachers

Small handful are willing to include names

Mostly anonymous - there are recurring reasons why, like professional risk, "it doesn't really matter now", somehow not wanting to damage the abuser's reputation

Why publish? It's not about pointing fingers and accusing specific people, but about showing how common these stories are, and how easy it is to identify or deeply understand these stories even if you've never been a victim

If we see that these stories are common, the victims gain huge amounts of power - they might not second-guess their decision to tell someone when it happens to them, they might identify markers of abuse earlier and stand up to it, and maybe the abusers can realize how their actions might be perceived and learn for the future
