Catalyst in Domingo case, initial call for stories

Near-immediate flow of emails with stories about themselves and their colleagues in shitty situations

Personal stories, open secrets, "I heard" stuff about select coaches/conductors/teachers

Small handful are willing to include names

Mostly anonymous - there are recurring reasons why, like professional risk, "it doesn't really matter now", somehow not wanting to damage the a user's reputation

Why publish? It's not about pointing fingers and accusing specific people, but about showing how common these stories are, and how easy it is to identify or deeply understand these stories even if you've never been a victim
