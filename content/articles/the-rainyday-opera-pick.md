It's a rainy day in Toronto, making me crave one of those good opera storms. I'm a bit overloaded on *The Barber of Seville*, so turn back now if you hoped for Rossini cleverness. but Italian storms are the good ones. So, here's one of my favourites: Domingo, Freni, and Cappuccilli in Verdi's *Otello*, led by Kleiber at La Scala in 1976. Curl up and get pulled in.
