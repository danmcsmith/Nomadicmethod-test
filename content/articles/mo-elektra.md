Minnesota Opera opened itâ€™s fifty second season on Saturday October 5 with _Elektra_ by Richard Strauss. The title character was sung by [Sabine Hogrefe](https://mnopera.org/biography/sabine-hogrefe/), a veteran of this opera who sings the role worldwide. She approached Elektra with the extreme drama that this tragedy deserves. [Marcy Stonikas](http://www.marcystonikas.com/) was Chrysothemis. There was good chemistry between the sisters.

[Victoria Vargas](The action of the opera is within the filming of a silent movie, beginning 15 minutes prior to downbeat The action began onstage fifteen minutes before the official 8pm start time with the opera within a film set action.), known in at the company for her big and small roles at MO over the years, brought her solid technique and rich voice to the maidservants' first scene. Oreste was sung by [Craig Irvin](/talking-with-singers-craig-irvin/).

The true stars of the night were the 85-piece orchestra, passionately led by [Elias Grandy](https://mnopera.org/biography/elias-grandy/) playing with a rich and sustained intensity throughout the night. The orchestra was onstage, and the space that would have usually been taken up by the pit was where the film crew was.

An uncredited actor played the omnipresent director of the fictional film. In a thick German accent, he introduced the opera and his film reminded the audience to silence their cell phones. Action began onstage fifteen minutes before the official 8pm start time, with film crew getting set and scenes being rehearsed. This prologue is about immersing the audience in the layered story-within-a-story device; it was a little reminiscent of _Ariadne auf Naxos_, with comic antics from the film crew.

Original footage from _Helena de troya_, directed by Manfred Noa, was shown in the first five minutes of the show, completely silent and it was slightly uncomfortable. Most opera goers don't come to sit and watch a screen in silence - I kept waiting for the orchestra to chime in. This screen stayed up in the first scene to show the footage made for this production, which was an interesting dramatic device.

Throughout the drama the projected film has a few purposes. It showed what was about to happen offstage; in the maids' scene one of the servants is led offstage to be beaten, and we get to witness that on the screen. During Elektra's entrance scene, the screen projects what was occurring currently on the stage, making it look as though the singers were lipsyncing. This is an odd in my opinion, but it achieves the larger-than-life drama that all Greek classics demand.

The cinematic display shows what the characters fantasize about in the immediate future. After the two murders, Oreste and his sisters are shown embracing and rejoicing in the palace together. But in the reality of the plot of the film and Strauss' opera, that never occurs.

Interestingly, the audience sees the singers transition from their _Elektra_ characters to play playing silent film actors, coming out of their dramatic scenes and "regrouping", smiling at the director, being kissed on the cheek by colleagues or giving handshakes.

The creative team certainly believes in the effectiveness of the film medium. I think it could have been trimmed a bit. Notably with the meandering dolly carrying a camera and two directors throughout the opera, the concept sometimes distracted from the artists on stage.

In fact we first see Elektra "off-camera" in a turban and dressing gown, giving off a distinctly [Norma Desmond](https://villains.fandom.com/wiki/Norma_Desmond) image. In fact, the framing of her death at the conclusion of the drama has elements of _Sunset Boulevard_ as well. 

In Strauss' opera, Elektra's plot succeeds and she begins to dance in victory but drops dead with the final chords of the opera. The same happens on the film set, but as the last moments of the music ring out, the production team stops and everyone realized the actress was actually dead. And blackout on sombre confusion.

I like this ending, because as the opera goes on, we see Elektra becoming more and more immersed in the violent obsessiveness of her character. On one occasion, she is led off-camera by some crew; as the camera is then pointed on some other action, and there is Elektra, wielding the axe lustfully. The director notices what she is doing, snatches the axe away, and leads her back to her mark for the next scene.

The parallel layers of a Greek character going mad and dying, and an artist being driven to death by her character were interesting to watch. But to make the latter more compelling, I think there needed to be more background on the actress and what factors may have contributed to her death. But interesting, nonetheless.
