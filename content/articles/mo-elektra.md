Minnesota Opera opened itâ€™s fifty second season on Saturday October 5 with _Elektra_ by Richard Strauss. The title character was sung by [Sabine Hogrefe](https://mnopera.org/biography/sabine-hogrefe/), a veteran of this opera who sings the role worldwide. She approached Elektra with the extreme drama that this tragedy deserves. [Marcy Stonikas](http://www.marcystonikas.com/) was Chrysothemis. There was good chemistry between the sisters.

[Victoria Vargas](The action of the opera is within the filming of a silent movie, beginning 15 minutes prior to downbeat The action began onstage fifteen minutes before the official 8pm start time with the opera within a film set action.), known in at the company for her big and small roles at MO over the years, brought her solid technique and rich voice to the maidservants' first scene. Oreste was sung by [Craig Irvin](/talking-with-singers-craig-irvin/).

The true stars of the night were the 85-piece orchestra, passionately led by [Elias Grandy](https://mnopera.org/biography/elias-grandy/) playing with a rich and sustained intensity throughout the night. The orchestra was onstage, and the space that would have usually been taken up by the pit was where the film crew was.

The director of the film - the omnipresent Fritz Lang - introduced the opera and his film, as well as telling the audience to silence their cell phones.

Original footage from _Helena de troya_, directed by Manfred Noa, was shown in the first five minutes of the show, completely silent and it was slightly uncomfortable. Most opera goers don't come to sit and watch a screen in silence - I kept waiting for the orchestra to chime in. This screen stayed up in the first scene to show the footage made for this production, which was an interesting dramatic device.

Throughout the drama, the projected film showed what was about to happen offstage not in real time (the beating of servants, for example), what is going on currently on the stage (almost as if the singers are lip syncing), what the characters fantasize might happen in the immediate future (Oreste and his sisters embracing and rejoicing in the palace together).

With all these different uses of the one dramatic tool, the creative team certainly believed in the effectiveness of the medium. I think it could have been trimmed a bit, because it distracted from the artists on stage. There was a dolly with a camera, and two directors that moved around throughout the opera.

This concept was interesting because the audience saw how the singers playing silent film actors would come out of their dramatic scenes and regrouping, smiling at the director, being kissed on the cheek by colleagues or handshakes.

In fact we first saw Elektra "off-camera" in a turban and dressing gown- giving off a distinctly Norma Desmond image. In fact the framing of her death at the conclusion of the drama had elements of Sunset Boulevard as well. In Strauss' opera, Elektra's plot succeeds and she begins to dance in victory but drops dead with the final chords of the opera. The same happens on the film set, but as the last moments of the music ring out, the production team stops and everyone realized the actress was actually dead. And blackout on sombre confusion.

I liked this ending, because as the opera went on, we could see Elektra becoming more and more immersed in the violent obsessiveness of her character. On one occasion, she was led off camera by some crew, and the camera obviously pointed on some other action, and there Elektra was, wielding the axe lustfully. The director notices what she is doing and snatched the axe away and leads her back to her mark for the next scene.

The parallel layers of a Greek character going mad and dying, and an artist being driven to death by her character were interesting to watch, but to make the latter more compelling I think there needed to be more background on the actress and what factors may have contributed to her death. But interesting nonetheless.
