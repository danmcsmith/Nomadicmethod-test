My pal [Chris Enns](/scene/people/christopher-enns/) is a [hardworking tenor](http://www.schmopera.com/on-the-road-the-bicycle-opera-project/), and creator of [Rags to Reasonable](http://www.ragstoreasonable.com/), a blog about personal finance geared towards artists. 

He's created this fantastic document, [The Big Book of Back to School](http://us10.campaign-archive1.com/?u=b87953eb96200303db4281a42&id=fe5172bd78), which is a wicked one-stop link for all your questions about budgets, working as an entrepreneur, and managing your happy factor as well as your money. 

I highly suggest bookmarking this newsletter, and paying regular visits to the [blog](http://www.ragstoreasonable.com/). To get to know Chris, have a look at our [interview](/chris-enns-rags-to-reasonable/) from earlier this year, or get right to the point with his [5 Money Tips for Artists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoaiRHHZcs).
