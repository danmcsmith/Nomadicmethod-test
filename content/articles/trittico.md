[Pacific Opera Victoria](/scene/companies/pacific-opera-victoria/) took on a massive undertaking in performing Puccini's _Il trittico_: three hour-long, one-act operas presented in a single performance. With a huge cast and three full productions, it's impossible to review it all, so I'll give the highlights of each.

Starting off the night is _Il tabarro_, a dark tale of betrayal and murder. Set on a small barge, the entire show takes place in a tiny space downstage, with a small dock and the barge being the only set pieces. It gives the feeling of being closed in, and the claustrophobia and inescapability of Georgetta's predicament.

The barge itself is small and narrow, with the smoke coming from the boat, and the reflection of water on the building behind. The only drawback of the production is the final fight scene, which in this performance felt under-rehearsed, and had the audience laughing at what should have been the dramatic climax. Despite that, the performers brought a great sense of tension to the story, and the sadness and desperation of the occupants.

_Suor Angelica_ takes place in a convent hospital, brilliant and luminous in shades of white and grey, with the sunlight pouring into the windows. Angelica's confrontation with her aunt take place in the garden, as the sun sets and the world turns dark. The ensembles of the piece are beautiful, though the pacing of the action is slow and the ending slightly overwrought. The duets and **

_Gianni Schicchi_ is presented as a group of travelling performers putting on the _commedia dell'arte_ of _Gianni Schicchi_. The costumes are riotous, colourful, and ridiculous, the action is madcap and frenetic, the acting is hilarious and pure buffoonery, and the result is a hilarious comedic romp to end the night on.

Each character is over-the-top in their absurdity, greed, or oafishness, and the troupe themselves are shown as being not overly skilled or professional, with costume pieces flung around the stage, including the corpse of Buoso himself being tossed unceremoniously offstage. The score is quite difficult, and the ensemble pieces were very well done, particularly the women's ensembles were polished and well balanced.

In an incredibly clever conceit by director Glynis Leushon, all the operas are linked to take place at the exact same time, one right after the other in the same place. The barge in _Tabarro_ is docked right next to the convent hospital where _Suor_ takes place, and the patients in the hospital are entertained by a troupe of _commedia_ performers with a play-within-a-play version of _Gianni Schicchi_, with the actors interacting with the hospital patients, and even with the conductor. It's a brilliant idea that tie all the operas together perfectly, and make three separate, stand-alone operas feel like a cohesive, single show.

[Aviva Fortunata](/scene/people/aviva-fortunata/) as Giorgetta is a standout in _Tabarro_, with a warm full soprano, and barely-contained frustration and anger at being made to stay on the boat. Her desperation when she tries to leave her estranged husband is palpable as she nearly betrays her plan to escape.

[Lara Ciekiewicz](/scene/people/lara-ciekiewicz/) as Lauretta was supremely lovely. With a brilliant high soprano, her "O mio babbino caro" was played with great comedic timing as the beautiful, but somewhat ditzy young girl desperate to marry her sweetheart.

[Todd Thomas](/scene/people/todd-thomas/) is a delightful Gianni Schicchi. Though encumbered with a ridiculously large fake nose, his characterization of the clever friend was hilarious, particularly when threatening the greedy family members by pretending to have his hands cut off.

Tenor [Owen McCausland](/scene/people/owen-mccausland/) as Tinca and Rinuccio was a huge standout. With a powerful, bright voice, he shone in both _Tabarro_ and _Schicchi_ in turns as the poetic drunk, and the amorous lover.

Mezzo-soprano [Megan Latham](/scene/people/megan-latham/) is a brilliant Frugola and Princess. With a beautiful, smooth mezzo voice, she was incredibly resonant and powerful, particularly in her lowest register, and her heartless portrayal of the Princess was menacing and pitiless.

Thomas Goertz as Talpa and Simone was funny and entertaining in both roles. With a polished, rich bass, his characterization of both roles was funny and charming.

Peter Monaghan as Betto di Signa was a hilarious buffoon. Played as a dumb, awkward dope, he was constantly fumbling around the stage, even crying at Lauretta’s plight. It was a joy to watch him just try to figure out what was going on.

In the very small role of the Cobbler was Dale Friesen. Despite only being on stage for a few minutes, he was vocally incredibly powerful, even hindered by a mask that hid most of his face. I loved his performance.

The difficult score was handled expertly by the POV orchestra under the baton of Timothy Vernon, beautifully underscoring the action on stage with subtlety and great technical musicality.

POV’s Trittico is a brilliant opening to a new season, and shows the innovation and risk taking that audiences have come to expect from the company. A great 3-in-1 production with something to offer for everyone.
