[Pocket Concerts](/scene/companies/pocket-concerts/) is a Toronto-based concert series, which brings chamber music to private homes, offices, and other intimate venues. Their most recent [public event](http://www.pocketconcerts.ca/#!public-pocket-concerts/c192n) was their November 29th Party with Brahms at the Wharf, hosted by Howard Cohen and Ron Solskone, where they treated audiences to string quintets and sextets by Brahms and Mozart. Over post-concert pizza and wine, we spoke with the artists, hosts, and listeners about the very special experience of a Pocket Concert.
