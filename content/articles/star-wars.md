There's definitely something operatic about watching _Star Wars: A New Hope_ on a screen dangling from the ceiling of Roy Thomson Hall, its famous original score in the expert hands of the Toronto Symphony Orchestra.

The crowd, full of fans of all ages, shared a level of love and nostalgia for the work of John Williams and George Lucas that rivals opera fans' loyalty to Verdi and Wagner. It's true that there are fewer variables with in-concert film - certainly so compared to opera, where all of a production's moving parts are happening live - but this audience also seemed less bothered by the bits that might have been unexpected: The subtitles ran throughout the film; the orchestra was sometimes too loud to clearly hear the dialogue; there was an intermission.

It's all stuff that, maybe for the most hardcore cinephile and _Star Wars_ lunatic, might have detracted from the experience. I certainly exercised a bit of will-power in my attempts to ignore the subtitles (except when they came in handy in the moments of acoustic imbalance), and at the end, when it became clear that we should indeed sit through the full credits - because John Williams - I suppressed an urge to do what I do at the movie theatre, which is not sit through the credits.

It was refreshing to note the differences in this crowd from the usual audience that attends the TSO's mainstage symphonic fare. There were a few costumes floating around the lobby - Darth Vader, a small wookiee, a nondescript Jedi - and there was a general air of fun. Conductor Sarah Hicks, whose résumé of Pops concerts is enormous and includes regular spots at the Hollywood Bowl and concerts with Smokey Robinson, appeared onstage holding a green lightsaber, "The best Amazon purchase I have ever made."

It's easy to notice the contrasts between going to _Star Wars_ in-concert and a Mahler symphony, and chalk it up to an obvious difference in fan base. That's an easy given, but with a bit more unpacking, it's clearly too simplistic a conclusion.

John Williams makes many nods to centuries past in his celebrated _Star Wars_ score: the beefed-up orchestra à-la-Mahler; the sweeping lines of Puccini, the _leitmotifs_ of Wagner.
