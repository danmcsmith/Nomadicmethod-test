"Absolute stillness is the thing about villainous people," says Canadian bass-baritone [Gerald Finley](/scene/people/gerald-finley/), who has been busy studying malevolence in preparation for his Iago in David Alden's stark production of Verdi's _Otello_ (running April 27 to May 21 at the Canadian Opera Company).

Shady characters aren't new for the affable Finley; before adding Iago, Baron Scarpia (_Tosca_), and Duke Bluebeard (_Bluebeard's Castle_) to his repertoire, his career was famously rooted in two of Mozart's most prominent cads, Don Giovanni (_Don Giovanni_) and Count Almaviva (_Le nozze di Figaro_).

Yet in the Shakespearean Iago, Finley finds "the perfect villain." The bass-baritone has done his homework on psychopathic behaviour, drawing on literature like Robert D. Hare's [Psychopathy Checklist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopathy_Checklist). Out of the checklist's twenty attribute to suggest psychopathic behaviour, "Iago checks all the boxes."

An expert at false charm, constantly adapting himself to earn trust from others, Finley uses physical stillness to portray the unnatural, unpredictable nature of a man like Iago.

"I think there's always this idea that a villain is at once attractive and dangerous," he says. "That's what I love about playing a part like \[Iago\], because he's always adjusting his demeanour, depending on who he's with." Only when Iago is alone, delivering his famous "Credo" in Act II, does he present his true self to the audience, and reveal what Finley calls, "the snake, the worminess."

Iago, with his intelligent and remorseless malice, is a role that sits confidently at the top of most baritone wish-lists. Finley is no exception, yet he had to prove his fitness for it.

Perhaps it comes as a surprise for his fans that Finley - a Grammy Award-winning artist, Commander of the Order of the British Empire, and general superstar in his discipline - would not have an standing invitation into the world of Italian lyric baritone repertoire.

"I've had to get into the what I call the villainous repertoire a little bit by insistence," says Finley of his work in roles like Iago and Scarpia. "My career is incredibly varied, and you wouldn't necessarily say an Italian lyric baritone would be singing Schubert songs."

Perhaps not - but it's easy to argue that they should. Until recently, Finley's career has been arguably light on Verdi; indeed, it seems as though he's been everywhere but. His is the voice that lends us definitive performances of Mozartean hits, of contemporary works like John Adams' _Doctor Atomic_ and Jaufr√© Rudel in Kaaija Saariaho's _L'amour de loin_. His are exemplary recordings of _Dichterliebe_ and _Winterreise_.

It's not how we imagine would be the lead-up to a baritone's arrival at Iago, or comparable Verdi roles like Conte di Luna in _Il trovatore_ or Rodrigo in _Don Carlo_. Yet who better but someone like Finley - trained in the detail work of German Lied, the subtle control of Mozart, and the unique challenges of new opera - to take on lyric baritone repertoire? To take on a Shakespearean villain? 

It seems even Finley is not immune to opera's knee-jerk tendency to categorize voices; they're not only identified by what they can do, but corollary assumptions are then made about what they cannot. Perhaps it's Finley's excellence in text delivery and subtle details that unfairly 

 "I'm trying to haul myself from a tradition," says Finley, "where there's been an unconscious but slightly less helpful move towards text, over the sounds of the voice."

* pigeon holing voices, creating an aesthetic separation between opera and recital/recording work
* legato, sound that a carries
* why he sings

\- **said, "look, I can do this" - Giovanni isnt' perceived as one, but he is one, the Count isn't a villain, but he has dark areas**

\- "It's the idea that my exploration of Verdi reeprtoire has been rather limited"

\- **Verdi baritone - "there's Rodrigo, Di Luna, these powerful symbols of what an Italian lyric baritone is"**

\- "For me, some of the most wonderful recordings I have are pre-War, where I'm hearing voices who are using the sound of their voice to colour"

\- "The real culprits are the recordsing themselves, when intimate micing became something where the soun dof a projected voice became a little strange"

\- "Even now, we listen to recordings and think, 'that's an old voice', because they were always projecting into a theatre."

\- "You then had the wonderful mic-friendly voices of Fischer-Dieskau"

\- **good example: Barry McDaniel (sp?), American, and Tom Krause**

\- "It was very much a heroic voice, and yet he could manage that colouring of words through the voice"

\- "You step back one small generation and get George London, and there was a powerful voice who still had much sensitivity to the words"

\- "We've left those voices behind"

\- **another example: John Tomlinson, powerful voice but attention to detail - "I've heard his Schwanengesang...The commitment to the art of communication is so fantastic"**

\- "The people with the vocal big chops haven't been given a chance" \[in art song\]

\- "The modern taste is for the intimate and the subtle"

\- "If you go and listen to Fischer-Dieskau, he is a classic bel canto singer"

\- "We still don't realize that singing is still this amazingly subtle art, but it's always based on this constant flow of sound"

\- "Modern audiences don't register necessarily that there is that constant sound"

\- "It upsets the actual flow of the sound" (aiming for super text delivery)

\- "I was taught not on legato...I really tried in the last 10 years to understand. I worked really hard to get into the idea that my voice can ride this constant wave"

\- "That's the sound that fills opera houses, that's the sound that gets over orchestras - the incessant reverberation of the voice"

\- "It's a train: it has cars attached, and the flow of sound is going along." **consonants are the breaks between the cars, if you make the gap too much, "It upsets literally the track"**

\- **YAPs lose focus with movement/fencing/etc  "Guys, let's get the voice sorted out"**

\- "You've only got 2 or 3 years when someone's listening"

\- "Once you get into the profession, no one's listening to you except those who employ you"

\- "I think we've survived, it hasn't been plain sailing the whole time"

\- "From really the advent of CDs, broadcasts, the Three Tenors, this idea that the classical singing world, in order to make it compete with the pop world, has to adapt some of the pop strategies"

\- "No, I think people need to hear what good singing's about"

\- "I think people, when they encounter Wagner or Verdi for the first time, it can be incomprehensible, it can be overwhelming"

\- **productions need to be straightforward for the sake of the audience**

\- "'Everybody knows Boheme', is often the conceit of directors"

\- "My feeling is that opera is trying to stretch itself into a) a cinema thing, a broadcastable thing, but it's a live event"

\- "I think that opera is only an extraordinary experience if it's live"

\- "I do believe that the miracle of the human voice, live instruments, and the risk of live theatre...that's the thing that makes me astounded"

\- "We do need the sensitivity of those directors who also know the music, who can feel the music, and who can make decisions about either enhancing or at least supporting the situation dramatically"

\- **McVicar, Alden, Sellars - "They know this music inside out. They don't need the score, they sing it"**

\- "That's when the confusion happens in the audience, they're being overwhelmed by visual things"

\- "Their minds and their souls are trying to put this together, and people come out half-moved"

\- "It doesn't matter how well you've sung or how well the orchestra's played, the poor people have been battered by her heart by the confusion"

\- "It's the ultimate involvement of what one can do. One is using eon's whole physical, mental, emotional self. One's life experience, one's relationships, one's channelling it through these glorious channels of composers and poets who are also presenting extraordinary things"

\- "It's such an honour, such a gift, such a hugely privileged thing to be a singer"

\- "That's why I think the classically trained voice is an enhanced vehicle of one's own soul, of one's thoughts"

\- "We are the speakers of society's ills and joys"

\- "I could be a very inefficient accountant, a very bad air pilot, I would have been a terrible vet."

\- "If I was put on the earth to do anything, this is it. It's huge, what we do"

\- "I hope that whenever I encounter any singer beginning out, that they understand that that's what they can be a part of"
