"Absolute stillness is the thing about villainous people," says Canadian bass-baritone Gerald Finley, who has been busy studying malevolence in preparation for his Iago in David Alden's stark production of _Otello_ (running April 27 to May 21 at the Canadian Opera Company).

Shady characters aren't new for the affable Finley; before adding Iago, Baron Scarpia (_Tosca_), and Duke Bluebeard (_Bluebeard's Castle_) to his repertoire, his career was famously rooted in two of Mozart's most prominent cads, Don Giovanni (_Don Giovanni_) and Count Almaviva (_Le nozze di Figaro_). 

Yet in Iago, Finley finds "the perfect villain." An expert at false charm, and

* why he sings

\- **he's OBE, a Commander of the Order of the British Empire__*

\- "The essence of any characterization, I think, is to find a single or perhaps a paired physical attribute, to find an idea of what the essence of the character is"

\- "if you're playing an easygoing or a romantic figure, generally there's this idea of fluidity and openness"

\- "A lyricism of physical movement"

\- "Absolute stillnesss is the thing about villainous people"

\- **unpredictable**

\- "Being able to charm or seduce or be very, falsely, lyrical"

\- "In order to gain trust"

\- "I think there's always this idea that a villain is at once attractive and dangerous"

\- **Giovanni, Scarpia**

\- "There's always a transaction somehow, and that transaction only happens, normally, between people who trust each other"

\- "That's almost why he's the perfect villain."

\- **Iago gains trust of Cassio, Rodrigo, Desdemona**

\- "Whoever he's with, he's absolutely their equal or has a reqlationship on their terms"

\- "That's what I love about playing a part like that, because he's alwasy adjusting his demeanour, depending on who he's with"

\- **In the Credo: "He is alone and he reveals the snake or the worminess"

\- "To prepare for it, reading things about psychopathic behaviour"

\- **The Psychopath Test, book by Jon Ronson**

\- **20 attributes - "And Iago ticks all the boxes"**

\- **Credo negates the test a bit, Iago knows he's doing bad and explains it in his way that he's human, born of original sin**

\- "He's very self-aware"

\- "I've had to get into the what I call the villainous repertoire a little bit by insistence"

\- **said, "look, I can do this" - Giovanni isnt' perceived as one, but he is one, the Count isn't a villain, but he has dark areas**

\- "It's the idea that my exploration of Verdi reeprtoire has been rather limited"

\- **Verdi baritone - "there's Rodrigo, Di Luna, these powerful symbols of what an Italian lyric baritone is"**

\- "My career is incredibly varied, and you wouldn't necessarily say an Italian lyric baritone would be singing Schubert songs"

\- "I'm trying to haul myself from a tradition which I believe is mid-late 20th century, where there's been an unconscious but slightly less helpful move towards text, over the sounds of the voice"

\- "For me, some of the most wonderful recordings I have are pre-War, where I'm hearing voices who are using the sound of their voice to colour"

\- "The real culprits are the recordsing themselves, when intimate micing became something where the soun dof a projected voice became a little strange"

\- "Even now, we listen to recordings and think, 'that's an old voice', because they were always projecting into a theatre."

\- "You then had the wonderful mic-friendly voices of Fischer-Dieskau"

\- **good example: Barry McDaniel (sp?), American, and Tom Krause**

\- "It was very much a heroic voice, and yet he could manage that colouring of words through the voice"

\- "You step back one small generation and get George London, and there was a powerful voice who still had much sensitivity to the words"

\- "We've left those voices behind"

\- **another example: John Tomlinson, powerful voice but attention to detail - "I've heard his Schwanengesang...The commitment to the art of communication is so fantastic"**

\- "The people with the vocal big chops haven't been given a chance" \[in art song\]

\- "The modern taste is for the intimate and the subtle"

\- "If you go and listen to Fischer-Dieskau, he is a classic bel canto singer"

\- "We still don't realize that singing is still this amazingly subtle art, but it's always based on this constant flow of sound"

\- "Modern audiences don't register necessarily that there is that constant sound"

\- "It upsets the actual flow of the sound" (aiming for super text delivery)

\- "I was taught not on legato...I really tried in the last 10 years to understand. I worked really hard to get into the idea that my voice can ride this constant wave"

\- "That's the sound that fills opera houses, that's the sound that gets over orchestras - the incessant reverberation of the voice"

\- "It's a train: it has cars attached, and the flow of sound is going along." **consonants are the breaks between the cars, if you make the gap too much, "It upsets literally the track"**

\- **YAPs lose focus with movement/fencing/etc  "Guys, let's get the voice sorted out"**

\- "You've only got 2 or 3 years when someone's listening"

\- "Once you get into the profession, no one's listening to you except those who employ you"

\- "I think we've survived, it hasn't been plain sailing the whole time"

\- "From really the advent of CDs, broadcasts, the Three Tenors, this idea that the classical singing world, in order to make it compete with the pop world, has to adapt some of the pop strategies"

\- "No, I think people need to hear what good singing's about"

\- "I think people, when they encounter Wagner or Verdi for the first time, it can be incomprehensible, it can be overwhelming"

\- **productions need to be straightforward for the sake of the audience**

\- "'Everybody knows Boheme', is often the conceit of directors"

\- "My feeling is that opera is trying to stretch itself into a) a cinema thing, a broadcastable thing, but it's a live event"

\- "I think that opera is only an extraordinary experience if it's live"

\- "I do believe that the miracle of the human voice, live instruments, and the risk of live theatre...that's the thing that makes me astounded"

\- "We do need the sensitivity of those directors who also know the music, who can feel the music, and who can make decisions about either enhancing or at least supporting the situation dramatically"

\- **McVicar, Alden, Sellars - "They know this music inside out. They don't need the score, they sing it"**

\- "That's when the confusion happens in the audience, they're being overwhelmed by visual things"

\- "Their minds and their souls are trying to put this together, and people come out half-moved"

\- "It doesn't matter how well you've sung or how well the orchestra's played, the poor people have been battered by her heart by the confusion"

\- "It's the ultimate involvement of what one can do. One is using eon's whole physical, mental, emotional self. One's life experience, one's relationships, one's channelling it through these glorious channels of composers and poets who are also presenting extraordinary things"

\- "It's such an honour, such a gift, such a hugely privileged thing to be a singer"

\- "That's why I think the classically trained voice is an enhanced vehicle of one's own soul, of one's thoughts"

\- "We are the speakers of society's ills and joys"

\- "I could be a very inefficient accountant, a very bad air pilot, I would have been a terrible vet."

\- "If I was put on the earth to do anything, this is it. It's huge, what we do"

\- "I hope that whenever I encounter any singer beginning out, that they understand that that's what they can be a part of"
