In the second of two videos covering the [Highlands Opera Studio](http://www.highlandsoperastudio.com/index.html#sthash.HxDVAQ9k.dpbs)'s current production of _Tosca_, we meet four of the supporting cast (your Angelotti, your Sacristan, your goons). They were kind enough to chat about the trick to learning smaller roles, and how the community in Haliburton, ON, has responded to this summer's Opera Studio.
_Tosca_ runs until August 28th at the Northern Lights Performing Arts Pavillion in Haliburton. [Click here for show details](http://www.highlandsoperastudio.com/performances.html#sthash.RnU8tFmh.dpbs), and click [here to buy tickets](https://www.highlandssummerfestival.on.ca/ticket-portal/).
