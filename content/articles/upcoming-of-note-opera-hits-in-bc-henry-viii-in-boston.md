Opera Kelowna also offers [_Opera in the Vines_](https://www.operakelowna.com/2019-opera-in-the-vines/) on August 2, a fab partnership with [Mission Hill Family Estate Winery](https://www.missionhillwinery.com/).

On the other coast, Boston-based [Odyssey Opera](/scene/companies/odyssey-opera/) is set to offer its latest in opera's under-performed masterpieces. Saint-Saëns' 1883 opera, _Henry VIII_, centres on the famed love triangle between the Tudor king, his first wife Catherine of Aragon, and his soon-to-be second wife, Anne Boleyn. "_Henry VIII_ has all the ingredients of a spectacular grand opera," says Odyssey Opera Artistic and General Director Gil Rose. "It has a sensational historical subject and sweeping vocal melodies and rich orchestral writing." The original score saw several cuts after its premiere, but Odyssey Opera is working with Saint-Saëns scholar Hugh MacDonald to put together a recreation that, "for all intents and purposes, represents the world premiere!"
