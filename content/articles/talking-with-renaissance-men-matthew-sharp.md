[Matthew Sharp](/scene/people/matthew-sharp/) is one of those tirelessly creative types. He's a [solo cellist](http://www.matthewsharp.net/cellist.html), [baritone](http://www.matthewsharp.net/bass-baritone.html), actor, director, and general theatre creator; as often as he can, Sharp combines all of the above into his work, earning himself the title, "virtuoso of the arts" (*The Times*). Our conversation was a complicated, enlightening one, so much so that a single interview wouldn't quite cut it. 

In the first of a three-part series, Sharp talks about the addition of singing to his life as a cellist, his "topsy-turvy" approach to working as an opera singer, and his fruitless quest for that fourth wall.
