Yesterday [Against the Grain Theatre](http://againstthegraintheatre.com/) announced the cast of [*A Little Too Cozy*](/atg-in-banff-2015/), who will spend 5 weeks at The Banff Centre, as part of [Open Space: Opera in the 21st Century](http://www.banffcentre.ca/programs/program.aspx?id=1532). This collaboration between AtG, the Banff Centre, and the Canadian Opera Company also includes a workshop and performance of *Crush*, a new opera by composer James Rolfe and librettist Anna Chatterton. *Crush* is based on the timeless story of Don Juan, but with a female Don, aptly named Donna. 

Get to know the cast of *Crush* right here.
