There's a question that crosses my mind fairly regularly, and since we've just gone through a wave of season announcements by some of North America's largest opera companies, I'm finally deciding to seek out an answer or two.

I'm outsourcing my question to you, readers, since I think the answer needs to be a group effort:

**What is the function of a major opera company in a large city?**

I'll explain my question a bit: in most North American metropolises with an opera scene, there is one large opera house, and a few small (and very small) companies. The large house has the money and man-power to do things like _Ring Cycles_ and _Turandots_ and operas by John Adams; the smaller companies are more agile, with fewer resources but less to lose, and they can put up chamber opera, lower-risk new works, and fun adaptations of classics like _La boh√®me_ and _The Barber of Seville_.

* people working everywhere in a country, except the major house
* are the major houses a network connecting cities to the broader scene?
* why are the headlining talents not more often local? Is that naive to ask of opera, which is inherently international? would it be robbing a city of great opera to limit the pool to their area?
