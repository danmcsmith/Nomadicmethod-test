* similar programme to _Harmonia Sacra_ from last year, plus latest commission by Edwin Huizinga, _Annunciation_
* according to Marshall, the new piece is still in progress, and there are plans to expand it for more voices/instruments, dramatic cantata or "maybe a one-act opera"
* Gledhill bridges stylistic gap before _Annunciation_ by joining Baroque dancers in preceding Purcell
* Jesse and Gledhill are vocal and physical manifestations of one protagonist (reminiscent of Gledhill in _Inception_/_Pygmalion_)
* _Annunciation_ is less compelling, but yet unfinished
* gives cool, tactile meaning to Purcell's Blessed Virgin (plus Gledhill, plus strains of Edwin when she calls for Gabriel)
* Edwin bridges stylistic gap again with these hints that precede _Inception_
* is Edwin into heavy metal?
