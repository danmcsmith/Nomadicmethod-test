What is this garbage? Domingo, Lord, Daniels, Dutoit, Levine; these are the recent ones, and absolutely not the last. All of them, offering gross forms of payment for the sex they have - or attempted to have - with those who are at best colleagues, and in reality, subordinates. Promises of career boosts, exclusive professional advice, and plain old wouldn't-it-be-hot-to-sleep-with-an-opera-star; these are the currencies of those in the opera business, recently outed by #MeToo.

Last year, when the [Levine stuff](/levines-ugly-exit-the-disposable-met/) was in full play, I told a friend that I was surprised Domingo hadn't yet been fingered (hah). I mean, if we're talking about "open secrets" of the industry, the kind of secret that's passed on dutifully to every young singer as they set their eyes on places like Tanglewood or Operalia or the MET, then Domingo is one of the big ones. Right now, I can recall a colleague and friend of mine, miming a blowjob as they talked about the latest recruits into one of the young artist programmes overseen by Domingo.

Levine was an open secret, too. I heard tales of his being confined to the conductor's podium whenever the kids' chorus was rehearsing on the stage of the MET. Like...

I'm just done with it. It's exhausting and gross and it makes me wonder if there's some giant overlap in the Venn diagram showing people who are into the performing arts and people who think it's fine to lord their status in the opera industry over those who seek mentorship, or at the very least, a great recommendation. Like, is it the whole thing about opera and passions running high? Are they turned on by each others' talent? Is it the fact that a lot of these people are nomadic and either single or away from their families for huge chunks of time? Are they extra lonely? Extra in need of ego stroking, and then some?

This stuff is happening in every industry, I know this. But opera seems to be particularly fertile for grossness; it's generally slow to change with the times, and some of the industry's most coveted, important career opportunities are still controlled by the likes of Domingo. And opera has a particularly rigid hierarchy, so clean-cut it's almost quaint; those who aspire to be a part of the opera industry learn quickly to smile and nod for the conductor, do everything the director asks, and don't be so ungrateful as to swat away an unwanted advance from the guy who can get you your next job.

Yeah, some of this shit happened three decades ago, when people - men, really - were mostly fine with creepiness.
