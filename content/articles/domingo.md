What is this garbage? Domingo, Lord, Daniels, Dutoit, Levine; these are the recent ones, and absolutely not the last. All of them, offering gross forms of payment for the sex they have - or attempted to have - with those who are at best colleagues, and in reality, subordinates. Promises of career boosts, exclusive professional advice, and plain old wouldn't-it-be-hot-to-sleep-with-an-opera-star; these are the currencies of those in the opera business, recently outed by #MeToo.

Last year, when the [Levine stuff](/levines-ugly-exit-the-disposable-met/) was in full play, I told a friend that I was surprised Domingo hadn't yet been fingered (hah). I mean, if we're talking about "open secrets" of the industry, the kind of secret that's passed on dutifully to every young singer as they set their eyes on places like Tanglewood or Operalia or the MET, then Domingo is one of  the big ones. Right now, I can recall a colleague and friend of mine, miming a blowjob as she talked about the latest recruits into one of the young artist programmes overseen by Domingo.

Levine was an open secret, too. I heard tales of his being confined to the conductor's podium whenever the kids' chorus was rehearsing on the stage of the MET; or the origin stories of the young pianists who found themselves among Levine's preferred music staff.

I'm just done with it. It's exhausting and gross and it makes me wonder if there's some giant overlap in the Venn diagram showing people who are into the performing arts and people who think it's fine to lord their status in the opera industry over those who seek mentorship, or at the very least, a great recommendation.

I'll lay out the caveat as concisely as I can: for a lot of these guys, they were being creeps 20-30 years ago, when it was more acceptable to be a creep.
