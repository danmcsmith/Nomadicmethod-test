Since John Cage didn't write anything easily defined as an opera, this is officially a topical digression. Concerning the above screenshot, possible explanations include:

* a hilarious coincidence concerning copyright infringement
* John Cage is haunting AdamLore and his YouTube channel
* AdamLore infringed upon copyright knowing that this would be perfect
