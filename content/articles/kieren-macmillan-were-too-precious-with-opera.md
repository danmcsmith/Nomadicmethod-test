I met composer [Kieren MacMillan](http://kierenmacmillan.info/) on a panel for Catherine Kustanczy's CIUT 89.5FM radio show, [Hydra](http://www.ciut.fm/shows-2/music-shows/hydra/), and I thought he was a man of great ideas. [Among other genres](http://kierenmacmillan.info/works/), Kieren writes music theatre and music drama/opera; I was curious about the differences in the workshopping process for each. Kieren speaks on the development of new opera from his own experience as a composer, and tells us about what stories are best set to music.
