[Mysterious Barricades](https://www.mysteriousbarricades.org/), the cross-Canada concert events for suicide awareness, prevention, and hope, is in its fourth annual iteration, running September 5-14, 2019.

In 15 cities across Canada, roughly 400 musicians are offering free live concerts, "for the purpose of providing healing and connection to those who are affected by suicide, either in surviving a loss or in dealing with their own mental health issues."

The series culminates on September 14, when from sunrise in [St. John's, NL](https://www.mysteriousbarricades.org/st-johns), to sunset in [Victoria, BC](https://www.mysteriousbarricades.org/victoria), all of the concerts will be broadcast online. The 17-hour Canadian concert event also includes a live concert in Toronto, at 1pm at 80 Queen's Park. 

This year's artists include Russell Braun, Elizabeth Turnbull, J. Patrick Raftery, Lara Ciekiewicz, Monica Whicher, Tracy Dahl, and Michael McMahon.

"Over 11,000 people have viewed our previous Mysterious Barricades concerts, which in addition to top-quality performances have included inspiring personal stories and valuable suicide prevention information."

All concerts are free to attend, and streamed free on September 14. For full details and to reserve tickets, visit the [Mysterious Barricades website](https://www.mysteriousbarricades.org/).
