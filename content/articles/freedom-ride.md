## What do you think is unique about the structure and aesthetic of _Freedom Ride_?

**Lydiya Yankovskaya**: Dan really understands vocal writing. He uses the voice effectively to portray a variety of characters, driving the action forward with the music and allowing every word to shine through clearly, while remaining unafraid to push the boundaries of what the voice can do.

## What do you think is the opera's message?

**LY**: This is a very human story about a young person who is discovering herself and weighing big life choices and their consequences. It is a story anyone can relate to - every day, each of us makes choices that affect our opportunities and impact the world and our loved ones.

## What can you tell us about the opera workshop process that readers may not know?

**LY**: An opera has so many elements and it takes a great deal of time to finesse and edit a work so it can be successful on the stage. A workshop allows the creative team to see the opera in context and to gauge audience reactions to it, without support from production elements like costumes and sets. During a workshop, we discover what is most moving and effective, what is clear to an audience and what doesn't come across, what passes by too quickly or drags on too long. All of those discoveries inform a composer's continued work on the piece.

## Where does this MassOpera presentation of _Freedom Ride_ fit in with the opera's workshop process?

**LY**: We are moving toward the end of the process, and are now finessing some finer dramaturgical points. With this workshop, we're focusing primarily on the way the orchestra interacts with the singers and addressing any orchestrating challenges.

## What do you hope audiences will take away from these performances?

**LY**: I hope that the audience members will see themselves in the characters on stage, that they will be moved and inspired by the stories those characters tell, and will come away reflecting on how those stories relate to our world today.
