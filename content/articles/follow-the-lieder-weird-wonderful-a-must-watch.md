This video series is totally confusing, and I can't look away.

[_Follow the Lieder_](https://www.facebook.com/FollowTheLieder/) is a series of short films by Alisdair Kitchen, produced by [Rye Arts Festival](https://ryeartsfestival.org.uk/) in association with the Royal College Of Music and National Opera Studio. As the name suggests, each video is set to German art song, among them Schubert's [_Versunken_](https://www.facebook.com/FollowTheLieder/videos/402622547279027/), [_Der Atlas_](https://www.facebook.com/FollowTheLieder/videos/1112493645607882/), and [_Die Forelle_](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1092557514467959).

They're totally bizarre. But fascinating, and I recommend them for a little musical rabbit-hole.

There are nine shorts in total, all available on [Follow the Lieder's Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/FollowTheLieder/). Here's my current favourite:
