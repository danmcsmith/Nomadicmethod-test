## You are from Canada. Maybe you could tell something about how is the music scene there and what was your upbringing?

I am from Victoria British Academy from the West Coast, and I stayed there for my undergraduate degree at the University of Victoria. It is a great place to be in with other cities in Canada. Because in Canada there are many rich different musical cultures. Not as rich as North America, but there is a lot of people that want to make music. Throughout my undergraduate I found my opportunities to sing and to learn and grow through the music. Once I finished there, I moved into the United States for a masters degree at the University of Michigan. It is a very good university and it was a very strong music scene there as well, but totally different. There were more people, who I could get answers from and when I finished my master degree, I went to Chicago where I did the young artist program with the opera house. It was great to be in an opera house, working with a lot of professional singers. Here at the Salzburger Festspiele is great to get to work alongside Russel Thomas, for example. Here are the top vocal artists from all over the world It is cool to be there. And now I will start working in Vienna. So everything is progressing very nicely. 

When you started your career, how did you understood it and how this understanding has transformed or changed? 

The moment when I decided to really commit to music, it was a very personal thing for me. I just love music, because it fulfills me more than anything else. I found music a little bit later in life, so I didn’t know I will become a singer when I was a kid. This happens to some vocalists, but for me, that happened much later and for first years my love for opera was evolving slowly since I really didn't know much about this art. I wasn’t raised listening to it, I saw it and actually, I didn’t get it as a child. And then I started working, reading, listening and taking everything in. 

It took me a while to figure out why I love opera. I love it because it is a triple threat. In North America, we call someone that sings, dances and acts a triple threat person. Therefore musical theater is usually called the triple threat of art forms because anyone that is in musical has to sing, dance and act. I also consider opera to be a triple threat of art forms, because there is singing, acting and usually a ballet involved. So many people are involved in this. I remember when I saw a production of La Traviata and I was just blown away – that was the second opera that I ever saw. They brought all of these dancers, there is a beautiful story and then there is the acting... It is overwhelming.  Since then I am trying to figure out what my career means to me because ultimately, I want to share this amazing art form with everybody. And that’s why I am happy to be here in Europe because there is such a beautiful appreciation of arts and people here really understands why it is so important. I am trying to bring such love, appreciation, and devotion to my country back to Canada. 

Do you think that music is a language and has some kind of verbal message?

I think music is a language and music came around because people were looking for a way to tell stories that had already been told but in a different manner. For example, you can go and watch “A Midsummer Night's Dream” the Shakespeare play, but you can also watch the opera by Benjamin Britten and it tells the same story, but you get something slightly different, because of the music. It is a very different expression of the emotional nature of humans. It is a struggle to talk or write about sadness, happiness, etc. It is hard to put all of these emotions on the page. But music can do that, so I think it is a very powerful language and it really touches people. For instance, you can hear someone say that they are sad, o you can go listen to Samuel Barber’s “Adagio for strings” and it would have a different, stronger effect. In that way, I think music has something to say. It is in-depth and simple yet complicated, beautiful, extravagant... We are still trying to figure out how does it work and why does music touch us so. 

How do you treat your voice in daily life?

There are certain things that I try not to eat. If I eat healthily then my body is healthy and thus my voice is healthy. I drink lots of liquids – tee, water. I don’t like drinking alcohol, because it can dry up the voice. Also, I like exercising in order to keep my body healthy. To find moments to be quiet and not to say anything, in order to relax and rest the voice. Singing is essentially controlled screaming. Whether if you were screaming or singing at the concert – the same effect will happen to your voice. While singing you have a protective background behind the scream, so you can control it and therefore scream longer (laughs).
