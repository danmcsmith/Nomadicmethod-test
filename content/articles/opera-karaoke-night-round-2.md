preamble = "Another Friday night, another Opera Karaoke night at the Royal Canadian Legion in Banff. The singers and pianists of Open Space: Opera in the 21st Century ventured down the mountain for some great music and good beer. This time, we were heavy on the duets (think *La bohème* and *The Phantom of the Opera*), and the Legion patrons even got a sneak peek of [Against the Grain Theatre](/scene/companies/against-the-grain-theatre/)'s upcoming *A Little Too Cozy*. Of course, our favourite #operababy, Sammy, joined us too."
