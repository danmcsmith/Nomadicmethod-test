Vancouver-born soprano [Simone Osborne](https://twitter.com/SimoneOsborne) is no stranger to the stage at the Four Seasons Centre. She's sung Oscar in _Un ballo in maschera_ (2014), Lauretta in _Gianni Schicchi_ (2012), Gilda in _Rigoletto _(2011), Pamina in _Die Zauberflöte _(2011), and she's mid-run as Nannetta in the Canadian Opera Company's current production of [_Falstaff_](http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/1415Season/Falstaff.aspx). Simone took time to chat with me about her time at the COC, and what she's learned along the way.
