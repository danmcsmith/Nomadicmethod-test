preamble = "You probably know American-Italian soprano Anna Moffo as Violetta, Susanna, Manon, Cio-Cio San, Périchole, Gilda, Lucia di Lammermoor, really any lead soprano role in Italian or French, it seems. Have you heard of her Italian TV show from the 1960s, *The Anna Moffo Show*? I think it's pretty darn impressive for a woman in Italy, 50 years ago, to have her own TV show; not to mention her hosting a revue while being the star singer. Curious? Check out this clip. There's air piano, and some *Aida*."

Television and film were always staples in Moffo&#039;s operatic career, and I think it&#039;s pretty darn impressive for a woman in Italy, 50 years ago, to have her own TV show."
