One would be hard-pressed to find someone who loves singers as much as Michael Shannon, pianist, coach, and répétiteur at the [Canadian Opera Company](/scene/companies/canadian-opera-company/). Michael is based in Toronto, and he's currently a member of music staff for the COC's upcoming production of *Le nozze di Figaro*.

Last year, Michael suffered an injury that significantly affected his ability to play the piano; after close to a year of questions, consultations, and slow recovery, he has some insight to share about the surprisingly common epidemic of injuries among instrumentalists, related directly or indirectly to their playing technique. 

Plus, he chats about the "beautiful pairing" of pianists and singers, and how he feels when he's around singing.
