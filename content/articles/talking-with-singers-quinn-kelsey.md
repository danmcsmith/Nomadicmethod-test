Baritone [Quinn Kelsey](http://www.quinnkelsey.com/index.htm) was born in Hawai'i, sings roles like Rigoletto and Germont all over the world, and lately he's been riding a donkey. He's getting ready to sing the role of Sancho, alongside the incomparable Italian bass, [Ferruccio Furlanetto](http://www.ferrucciofurlanetto.com/), in the Canadian Opera Company's upcoming production of _[Don Quichotte](http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/1314Season/DonQuichotte.aspx)_. Massenet's Sancho is a role debut for Quinn, and he took time before rehearsal to talk about working with stars, riding donkeys, and car analogies.
