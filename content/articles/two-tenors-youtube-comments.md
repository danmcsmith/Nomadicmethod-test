Eager for topical conversation, I showed Canadian tenors [Christopher Mayell](http://christophermayell.com/) and [Isaiah Bell](http://isaiahbell.com/) some comments made about one of those videos with one of those "child opera singers" singing Puccini. Specifically, whether or not 9-year old [Amira Willighagen](http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/591307-amira-willighagen-9-year-old-opera-wonder-releases-debut-cd/) was better than 11-year old [Jackie Evancho](http://www.jackieevancho.com/ca). It got pretty real.
