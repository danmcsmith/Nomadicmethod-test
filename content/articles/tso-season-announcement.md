The Toronto Symphony Orchestra's 2019-20 season will be, one hopes, the last in a while without the appointment of a permanent Music Director. Interim Artistic Director Sir Andrew Davis has returned to the TSO following Conductor Emeritus Peter Oundjian's exit at the end of the 2017/18 season; incoming Music Director Gustavo Gimeno, set to officially begin his tenure in the fall of 2020, will be in town to conduct a handful of concerts this season, and whetting the audience's appetite.

In fact, the TSO's past, present, and future will all take the podium in 2019/20. In the fall Gimeno will conduct a Russian-French programme (October 9-12, 2019), and he'll return in April for a concert of Brahms featuring star pianist Yuja Wang (April 8-11, 2020). Oundjian will return for a hefty concert of Mahler's Symphony No. 5 and Bruch's _Violin Concerto_, featuring TSO Concertmaster Jonathan Crowe (April 29-May 2, 2020). And Sir Andrew Davis will be a season-long presence as a conductor, a composer, and even as an organist for Saint-Saëns' "Organ Symphony" (June 17-21, 2020).

Though these seasons of transition are perhaps light on the contemporary repertoire and outside-the-box projects which are easier to pull off with permanent management, the TSO is falling wisely back onto the massive canon of traditional symphonic masterworks. Like the current season, the TSO's line-up for next year gives afficionados the chance to hear live a good chunk of their symphonic repertoire bucket list: Vivaldi's **_Four Seasons_**, featuring Jonathan Crowe (November 16-20, 2019), **Dvořák's Cello Concerto**, featuring Joseph Johnson (January 30-February 1, 2020), Mussorgsky's **_Pictures at an Exhibition_** (March 20-22, 2020), Strauss' **_Also sprach Zarathustra _**(June 17-21, 2020),
