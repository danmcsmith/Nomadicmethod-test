Next month, Toronto will see the results of a new collaboration between two exciting and innovative groups of musicians. [The Bicycle Opera Project](/on-the-road-the-bicycle-opera-project/), Canada's only opera company who arrives at every show by bike, is teaming up with [Toy Piano Composers](/scene/companies/toy-piano-composers/), a collective of nine composers who champion the creation of new music, and present it in a fun, listeners-first way. 

Bicycle Opera and Toy Piano Composers will premiere [*Travelogue*](http://bicycleopera.com/2016-season/), a new collection of operas by composers Monica Pearce, Elisha Denburg, August Murphy-King, Tobin Stokes, and librettist Colleen Murphy. *Travelogue* is exciting in itself, and it's part of Toy Piano Composer's inaugural new music festival, [*Curiosity Festival*](http://toypianocomposers.com/Toy_Piano_Composers/curiosity_festival.html), happening **April 1-9th** at Toronto's Arts & Letters Club, the Canadian Music Centre, and Heliconian Hall (find out all about it [right here](http://toypianocomposers.com/Toy_Piano_Composers/curiosity_festival.html)).

Toy Piano co-founders [Monica Pearce](/scene/people/monica-pearce/) and [Chris Thornborrow](/scene/people/chris-thornborrow/), plus Bicycle Opera's Artistic Director [Larissa Koniuk](/scene/people/larissa-koniuk/) and co-producer [Geoffrey Sirett](/scene/people/geoffrey-sirett/), all took the time to chat about their new partnership, and why they're excited to show everyone the fruits of their labour.
