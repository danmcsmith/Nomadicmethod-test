After a four-year hiatus, Journey Opera North resumes their artistic activities with Britten's _The Rape of Lucretia_ at The Minnsky Theater in North West Minneapolis. Producer Colleen Meier introduced the show to the audience by saying that it was "just the perfect time" to put on an ambitious production of the musically difficult and thematically dark Britten opera. Given the #MeToo movement and most recently, the allegations of harassment against Plácido Domingo, I tend to agree.

Costume designer [Stacey Palmer](https://staceyjpalmer.wixsite.com/costumedesign) outdid herself on the Greek Chorus' costumes. The Male Chorus (sung fiercely and with crystal clear diction by tenor Wesley Frye) was dressed as half man half stag. The Female Chorus, played by lyric soprano [Amy Wolf](http://amywolfsoprano.com/) was a more feminine version and also had antlers. The head pieces were quite ornate.

The third member of the chorus, who was conceived for this production, was aerialist Jolie Meshbesher, donned a simple leotard with some wickedly long eyelashes that looked like twigs. There was a definite earthy and mystical theme to the chorus costumes. 

The rest of the cast wore typical Roman duds. The action began with the entire cast coming out wearing blind folds (Lucretia's and Collatinus' was white, Tarquinius' black, servant women's were beige. During the initial moments of music the women were in front, but then went to the back of the stage which was steps up, and started spinning while the men's action began.

The company employed intimacy and violence choreographer, [Mason Tyer](https://minnesotaplaylist.com/talent/mason-tyer-0). The fight between Tarquinius and Junius in the first act was exhilarating to watch, passions ran high. Tarquinius was sung by baritone Sullivan Ojala Holt. Joe Allen sang a sinister Junius with an electrifying baritone. The ensemble energy was palpable, the thirteen piece chamber orchestra was led by [Brian Dowdy](http://www.briandowdy.com/guitarist_conductor/Home.html). He created a sensitive environment for the singers to shine as Britten intended.

An interesting choice by director Amanda Carlson, was the deity status of the Chorus. What stretched my mind from the previous productions that I have seen, was the fact that the Male Chorus was just as goading as Junius towards Tarquinius. Most interpretations make the Chorus the horrified observers, but the Male Chorus seemed blood thirsty throughout.

The confrontation/rape scene was where Ms. Moynihan's powerful mezzo voice rang out. Her emotions run the gambit in this scene from sensual desire (when she believes Tarquinias is her husband Collatinus), to fear, pleading, rage and shame. Ms. Moynihan effectively portrayed them in the colors of her voice. Most of the confrontation took place on the same level as the audience, but the assault was on the raised level. Once the Male and Female Chorus took over narrating the horrific act, Tarquinias’ actions became slow motion. Though the creative team chose a less explicit approach to the crime, the slow motion made it extremely disturbing. The audience was able to see Lucretia’s face the entire time, while the Chorus and orchestra played crashing and clashing chords of agony. An effect dramatic choice that equally highlighted the power of the music, text and acting abilities of the cast.

Lucretia committed suicide robed in purple an obvious Christ image (Jesus was dressed in a purple robe after being scourged by Roman guards). After Lucretia's suicide the chorus put the blind folds back on the characters, except for the young servant Lucia. Lucia was sung by [Carole Schultz](https://caroleschultz.com/). Lucia’s naivete and adoration for Lucretia was evident during the entire opera, and it was clear that after the suicide and subsequent political manuevers that Lucretia’s corpse used to further, Lucia could not return to the blindess that the others did. Everyone seemed to accept and return to their routine after her death. Perhaps this was Ms. Carlson’s main point, horrific rape still in accounted for of course, the use of women in war and politics throughout the ages. While the Male Chorus took the final minutes to state that Christianity will wipe away the suffering in 500 years, the Female Chorus woke Lucretia and she seemed to join the deity chorus, while the rest of the players in her tragedy moved on from her death. A grim sight in contrast with the Christian message that it was all going to be alright in five hundreds years, Lucretia seemed to have earned the right to observe humanity from the mythological creatures comfortable distance.

A powerful and symbolic rich production by the whole creative team and cast at Journey Opera North. I can’t wait to see what they have to offer the Twin Cities art scene in the future!
