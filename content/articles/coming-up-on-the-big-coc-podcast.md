A little while ago, I was invited to be a guest on _[The Big COC Podcast](http://www.coc.ca/ExploreAndLearn/NewToOpera/OnlineLearningCentre/Podcasts.aspx)_, hosted by Gianmarco Segato. I joined arts journalist Paula Citron and conductor Stephen Lord in a chat about some of the hotter opera topics. And they let me bring my camera, which means you all get to see a short preview.
