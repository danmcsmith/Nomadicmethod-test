</figure>

That's right. Stuart the Minion spots a fine-looking yellow fire hydrant in New York City, and he uses his best pick-up line, best translated as, "Hello, Papagena! You're beautiful like a papaya."

Now all we can think about is a Minion-Papageno, and how much that needs to happen in our lifetime. Can you picture Papageno's Suicide Scene in those little overalls? Come on.
