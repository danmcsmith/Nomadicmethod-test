American dramatic soprano [Heidi Melton](http://www.heidimeltonsoprano.com/)  is currently in Toronto to sing Sieglinde in Atom Egoyan's upcoming production of [Die Walküre](http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/1415Season/DieWalkure.aspx)  at the Canadian Opera Company. She was lovely, and kind enough to talk about singing Wagnerian roles, and the slow burn that is *Der Ring des Nibelungen*.

*Die Walküre* runs at the Four Seasons Centre from January 31st-February 22nd. [Click right here](http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/1415Season/DieWalkure.aspx) for details and to purchase tickets.
