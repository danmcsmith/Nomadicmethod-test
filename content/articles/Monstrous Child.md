I find orchestration is a bit liek puzzle-solving (**like finding how to make the sound you want with the instruments available**)

I don't find it as taxing as composing, I quite enjoy it

No pressure *laughs*

It's the first time I've ever written for voices, so it's extra pressure

\**UK brass band tradition family

As far as I'm concerned, opera is just theatre, where people sing

\**saw Le grand macabre at ENO, got turned onto it**

I went to see lots and lots of opera here in London

\**started thinking about writing one himself**

\**he wrote a few ballets**

I got a real taste for collaborating and writing for the stage

\**Norse goddess Hel, the teenage ruler of the underworld**

\**He was given a copy of the book**

I thought it was brilliant, witty, and funny

It's basically what Wicked is to the Wizard of Oz, but to the Ring Cycle

\**they proposed it to ROH, did a workshop**

They commissioned it straight away, on the day - which is apparently unheard of

We're putting as a family opera

It's not for young kids, it's probably for teenagers and up

It's a teenage coming-of-age story, but she happesn to be a half-dead, half-alive goddess who lives in the Norse underworld

She's the ultimate teenage girl who is having the worst time in life

\**goddess from the waist up, rotting corpse from the waist down**

She's aware that she smells because she's rotten - **general self esteem issues**

\**she falls for Baldr, who is the first guy who be nice to her**

\**Simon** - It's probably the only opera where the last person standing is the female lead

I've harvested other operas for model

\**the ending is inspired by Peter Grimes - gods dying in the distance, Hel stuck alone**

It's quite an eclectic opera, I think

\**learned about text clarity and tessitura through process, comparing range to what he knows about brass instruments - ie. trumpet is similar to soprano**

\**surprised by the variety of voices even within a voice type** 

I kind of assumed there was a soprano model, and sopranos sounded something like that

It's sort of about accepting yourself, forgiving yourself, and owning your mistakes
