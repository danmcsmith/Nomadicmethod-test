"It's a teenage coming-of-age story, but she happens to be a half-dead, half-alive goddess who lives in the Norse Underworld," says composer Gavin Higgins of his new opera, [_The Monstrous Child_](https://www.roh.org.uk/productions/the-monstrous-child-by-timothy-sheader). 

Running 21 February to 3 March at the The Royal Opera House's  Linbury Theatre, _The Monstrous Child_ is the operatic adaptation of the teen fiction book by Francesca Simon. Drawn from Norse mythology, the story centres on Hel, the teenage goddess who presides over the dead. Higgins describes the opera, which shares source material with the expansive works of Wagner, as "basically what _Wicked_ is to _The Wizard of Oz_, but to the _Ring Cycle."_

When we spoke, Higgins was finishing his orchestration in anticipation for the first rehearsals with the Aurora Orchestra. "I don't find it as taxing as composing," he says of orchestration. "It's a bit like puzzle-solving." _The Monstrous Child_ marks Higgins' first opera, and even his first foray into writing for the voice. He comes from a familial line of brass band players, and got the opera bug after seeing Ligeti's _Le grand macabre_ at English National Opera. He read Simon's book, which he deemed both brilliant and operatic, and brought a workshop-ready score for proposal to the Royal Opera House. After the work's single workshop, Higgins recalls, "they commissioned it straight away. Which is apparently unheard of."

Though still young, Higgins is a seasoned composer; and though there are learning curves to writing for the voice, he wisely keeps his eyes on the final product, what he calls a "coming of age story". Hel, burdened with the same teenage struggles as the rest of us - issues of self-esteem and unrequited crushes - is "the ultimate teenage girl who is having the worst time in life."

* opera's origins, Simon's book, quick ROH commission
* got into opera, brass band tradition, learning about voices
* finishing orchestration

I find orchestration is a bit like puzzle-solving (**like finding how to make the sound you want with the instruments available**)

I don't find it as taxing as composing, I quite enjoy it

No pressure _laughs_

It's the first time I've ever written for voices, so it's extra pressure

\**UK brass band tradition family

As far as I'm concerned, opera is just theatre, where people sing

\*_saw Le grand macabre at ENO, got turned onto it_*

I went to see lots and lots of opera here in London

\*_started thinking about writing one himself_*

\*_he wrote a few ballets_*

I got a real taste for collaborating and writing for the stage

\*_Norse goddess Hel, the teenage ruler of the underworld_*

\*_He was given a copy of the book_*

I thought it was brilliant, witty, and funny

\*_they proposed it to ROH, did a workshop_*

They commissioned it straight away, on the day - which is apparently unheard of

We're putting as a family opera

It's not for young kids, it's probably for teenagers and up

\*_goddess from the waist up, rotting corpse from the waist down_*

She's aware that she smells because she's rotten - **general self esteem issues**

\*_she falls for Baldr, who is the first guy who be nice to her_*

\*_Simon_* - It's probably the only opera where the last person standing is the female lead

I've harvested other operas for model

\*_the ending is inspired by Peter Grimes - gods dying in the distance, Hel stuck alone_*

It's quite an eclectic opera, I think

\*_learned about text clarity and tessitura through process, comparing range to what he knows about brass instruments - ie. trumpet is similar to soprano_*

\*_surprised by the variety of voices even within a voice type_*

I kind of assumed there was a soprano model, and sopranos sounded something like that

It's sort of about accepting yourself, forgiving yourself, and owning your mistakes
