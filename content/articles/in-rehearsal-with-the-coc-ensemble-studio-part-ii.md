The COC Ensemble Studio's performance of *The Barber of Seville* happens this coming Friday, May 15th at the Four Seasons Centre. Following up to [Part I](/in-rehearsal-with-the-coc-ensemble-studio/), I was able to a) invade their rehearsal a little bit, and b) sit down and chat with the rest of this fantastic cast. 

We've got the barber himself, [Clarence Frazer](/scene/people/clarence-frazer/), who also made an unexpected appearance as Figaro in last night's performance of *Barber*, stepping in for baritone [Joshua Hopkins](/talking-figaro-with-joshua-hopkins/). The supportive (read: hilarious) characters are [Karine Boucher](/scene/people/karine-boucher/) is Berta, [Gordon Bintner](/scene/people/gordon-bintner/) sing Don Basilio, and the blustering Bartolo is played by [Iain MacNeil](/scene/people/iain-macneil/).
