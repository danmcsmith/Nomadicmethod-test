I figure Mozart's _Idomeneo_, his 1780 opera seria rooted in Greek mythology, is one of those operas that make directors skittish. _Idomeneo_, filled with mature, breathtaking music, can so easily keep an audience at arm's length. Much of the opera is a string of substantial arias, a form that seems slightly archaic in the hands of Mozart, which continuously puts the plot on pause. 

If you're not up on your Greek/Trojan history, there's little to save you in the pages of Mozart's score. We are not introduced to these characters - rather, dropped in to view a window in the lives of large mythological figures, with personal histories that are assumed to be familiar. That assumption was likely a stretch in the 18th century, let alone today.

My curiosity was piqued for this revival of Opera Atelier's production of _Idomeneo_, first put up in 2008. Mozart is on the late end of the 17th- and 18th-century works that are Atelier's focus, making it an interesting test of the tried-and-true aesthetic of Co-Artistic Directors Marshall Pynkoski and Jeannette Lajeunesse Zingg.

"There's a serious storm brewing," said Pynkoski in his pre-show audience address, "and I predict major turbulence ahead." He was referring to the the storm that the sea god Neptune churns up, hurling Idomeneo and his sailors onto the shores of Crete. But there was turbulence too, as this production resounded into the Ed Mirvish Theatre.

If turbulence is too exaggerated at term, perhaps one could instead say that there was disconnect in this production. The singing was a veritable mixed bag. Meghan Lindsay sounded her best yet as Ilia, sending gathered, rich sounds out into the hall; Wallis Giunta was an athletic Idamante, her physicality dominating her singing, and at times keeping her from finding her most grounded sound; Colin Ainsworth is an open, honest Idomeneo, almost bordering on wild.

And Measha Brueggergosman as Elettra, the literal poster child for this production, seemed to pair lovely, inspired moments of singing with a few pervasive rookie mistakes. She stood out onstage, moving heavily and without the taut precision of Atelier's more common 

There was disconnect in the production, too, flashes of elements that run parallel instead of together. There was random sexiness - nearly nude, heaving male forms, breathless bosoms in corsets, Giunta's signature long red hair flowing freely as Idamante - that seemed like toppings rather than substance. There was the use of [rhetorical gesture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chironomia) - one of the most notorious through-lines  of Opera Atelier's productions - which is meant to tell and enhance a story; in this _Idomeneo_, the gestures seemed particularly canned, belittling the emotional crises and bleeding into similarly meaningless wanderings across the stage - denoting general torment, I gather. 

More than beautiful people,  I craved, rather, some hints of real humanity in these archetypal characters. Without translating 

* 
* painted backdrop, 2 benches stage right and left - classic Atelier set
* 
* heaving male form (Neptune)
* Meghan sounds her best yet as Ilia
* slight echo in theatre, almost like a meta-theatrical effect
* rhetorical gestures stop helping this narrative, almost the wrong fit for Mozart
* distracting sexy: thigh straps, long red hair on Idamante, heaving bosoms, heavy breathing male forms
* Wally - ungrounded, her trouser-role physicality detracts/doesn't help technique
* when gestures work, they're organic and I don't notice them as a medium - here, I notice them
* this is why this opera holds modern audiences at arm's length, because so much of the character is already laid out from myth - without breathing fresh, human life into them, we can't care about them
* everyone in this cast sings differently - Meghan's gathered and beautiful, Wally is physically driven, Colin is open and honest (wild), Measha is a mess
* vague-meaningless/canned wandering across the stage, tormented
* this production doesn't trust the music
* Measha stands out - she moves differently, without the taut energy of this cast, making the most volatile character of this opera - would have worked if she planted and sang a bit more, but she was ungrounded there, making rookie mistakes
* Measha's act II aria is the best singing
* Neptune - "It sings!" - his sound is fab
