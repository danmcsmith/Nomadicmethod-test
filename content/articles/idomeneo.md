* 
* painted backdrop, 2 benches stage right and left - classic Atelier set
* "there's a serious storm brewing, and I predict major turbulence ahead"
* heaving male form (Neptune)
* Meghan sounds her best yet as Ilia
* slight echo in theatre, almost like a meta-theatrical effect
* rhetorical gestures stop helping this narrative, almost the wrong fit for Mozart
* distracting sexy: thigh straps, long red hair on Idamante, heaving bosoms, heavy breathing male forms
* Wally - ungrounded, her trouser-role physicality detracts/doesn't help technique
* when gestures work, they're organic and I don't notice them as a medium - here, I notice them
* this is why this opera holds modern audiences at arm's length, because so much of the character is already laid out from myth - without breathing fresh, human life into them, we can't care about them
* everyone in this cast sings differently - Meghan's gathered and beautiful, Wally is physically driven, Colin is open and honest (wild), Measha is a mess
* vague-meaningless/canned wandering across the stage, tormented
* this production doesn't trust the music
* Measha stands out - she moves differently, without the taut energy of this cast, making the most volatile character of this opera - would have worked if she planted and sang a bit more, but she was ungrounded there, making rookie mistakes
* Measha's act II aria is the best singing
* Neptune - "It sings!" - his sound is fab
