Canadian tenor [Aaron Ferguson](http://www.aaronferguson.net/#!bio/c2ih) is a busy guy. He's sung at the Glimmerglass Festival, Opéra de Montréal, Pacific Opera Victoria, and the Royal Opera of Versailles. He just closed a run of Lully's _Persée_ here in Toronto at [Opera Atelier](http://www.operaatelier.com/), and he's getting ready to [take it to Versailles](http://www.operaatelier.com/dreaminversailles) later this month. I caught him between _Persée_ shows, bribed him with a beverage, and asked him some questions about his unique spot in the operatic industry as a [_comprimario_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprimario) tenor.
