Canadian tenor [Christopher Mayell](http://christophermayell.com/) is  [no stranger to Schmopera](http://schmopera.com/tag/christopher-mayell/). This time I asked him if he would chat about the realities of a career as an opera singer. Financial struggles and lost inspiration are part of the opera singer's trip, and Chris talks about his own experiences in a frank, important interview. He chats about his singing life, the IT business he started [Perfect Fit Computers](http://perfectfitcomputers.ca/), and how they work together. Enjoy!
