Around eight years ago, I had a teacher in my undergraduate degree who was emotionally abusive. I have to really sit down and think about the things she said to me, because I have blocked out so much. 

The one thing she said that never left me was the virgin-shaming. She said that maybe if I had sex or got a boyfriend, that it would relax me and make me a better singer. These insinuations or outright comments went on for the three years I studied with her. 

The only reason I didn't leave her studio was because I knew I wouldn't get any leads if I left. I got lead roles over better singers just because I was in her studio. Weird power dynamics.
