Alright. Hi, everyone.

I figure those of you reading this post are many of the same people who have been following #TheStories. It's a series of posts that tell stories of sexual abuse, harassment, and assault within the realms of opera and classical music. I received tons of them, and I posted 15. That might not sound like a huge number, but let's think on it: that's 15 people who have stories to tell, out of the small pool of opera folk, and the even smaller pool among those who closely follow Schmopera, and the still smaller pool of those who feel inclined to re-live their experiences with enough detail to write it down in an email.
