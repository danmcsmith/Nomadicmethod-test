Alright. Hi, everyone.

I figure those of you reading this post are many of the same people who have been following #TheStories. It's a series of posts that tell stories of sexual abuse, harassment, and assault within the realms of opera and classical music. I received tons of them, and I posted 15. That might not sound like a huge number, but let's think on it: that's 15 people who have stories to tell, out of the small pool of opera folk, and the even smaller pool among those who closely follow Schmopera, and the still smaller pool of those who feel inclined to re-live their experiences with enough detail to write it down in an email.

I'm still receiving stories, nearly three months after this whole thing kicked off. That's a long time to maintain momentum, in internet land. And so there's a part of me that is so proud that there are brave people still reaching out, politely inquiring if I'm still interested in hearing what they have to say. Absolutely, I'm interested. Someone has to be, after all. Part of this whole problem is that these victims didn't think they had anyone to tell.

But I have to put it on pause. As much as I want to lean into this thing, and endlessly press the point that #metoo is _everywhere_ in this industry, I have to admit it's getting to me. It's not fun to read these stories with an editor's level of detail. It's not fun - for me or for the author, obviously - to get on the phone with victims and go through it all again, clarifying details and discussing whether or not to name the abuser. 

It's certainly not fun to know this shit, to know it about specific people, some of whom walk in my own industry circles. You likely noticed that most of the stories are anonymous - but that doesn't mean I never got a name. It's a weird mix of feeling entrusted with delicate information, and feeling laden with a secret that's not mine to tell.

But something like #TheStories is, at the very least, worthy of some reflection. The feedback to the series has been largely positive. You, the readers, have stood in internet solidarity with these victims, with a unanimity that took me by honest surprise. It was always there, but the
