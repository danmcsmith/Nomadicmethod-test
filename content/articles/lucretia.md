Newly minted Twin Cities opera company [Journey Opera North](https://www.journeynorthopera.com/) will be presenting Benjamin Britten's _The Rape of Lucretia_ for their inaugural stage production, September 6-8, 2019. 

In a preview on Monday, the company showed an impressive cast of young local talent and a very thoughtful premise for the controversial show. The company has also included a violence and intimacy director in the production - a presence that, hopefully, will some day be a regular credit in programs. 

As a special note, the company has included an aerial performer into the show, since the venue (Minnsky Theater) is primarily known for burlesque performances. I am sure it will be an interesting production.
