On May 15th, 2015, the [Canadian Opera Company Ensemble Studio](http://www.coc.ca/AboutTheCOC/CompanyMembers/EnsembleStudio.aspx) takes the Four Seasons Centre stage in their [unique performance of *The Barber of Seville*](http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/1415Season/BarberofSeville/EnsembleStudioPerformance.aspx). It's a big deal for these young artists to step into the mainstage roles of this ongoing production by Els Comediants, and the hype has earned them a sold-out show.

I was able to chat with mezzo-soprano [Charlotte Burrage](/scene/people/charlotte-burrage/) (Rosina), and her two Count Almavivas, [Andrew Haji](/scene/people/andrew-haji/) (Act I) and [Jean-Philippe Fortier-Lazure](/scene/people/jean-philippe-fortier-lazure/) (Act II), about enjoying the big stage and the supportive audience. They were even kind enough to let me bring my camera to their rehearsal with [Clarence Frazer](/scene/people/clarence-frazer/) (Figaro) and [Iain MacNeil](/scene/people/iain-macneil/) (Bartolo).
