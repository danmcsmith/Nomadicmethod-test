Tapestry Opera's latest commission is a compact, intermission-free piece of organic theatre that has all the pieces in place. Hook Up is the work of composer Chris Thornborrow and librettist Julie Tepperman; in 90 minutes of music, singing, and drama that straddles the styles of opera and musical theatre, Hook Up tells the story of a young woman's first few months as a new university student.

It's all terrifyingly familiar.

There's Mindy's best friend Cindy, who is overjoyed to be single for her freshman year, and who dives into her new social life with no fear. There's Mindy's boyfriend, Tyler, who's torn between genuine affection for his girlfriend, and the freshman year opportunities to meet new people and go to new parties.

The men and women get advice from their orientation leaders that's conspicuously different - the men are perfunctorily advised to behave themselves, and the women are imperfectly urged to watch their drinks at parties. Cindy and Mindy get into a petty fight during class, first in angry whispers, and then in emoji-speak, all while ignoring the ongoing lecture on Feminism 101.

I spent the night growing more and more uncomfortable. I'm about ten years out of my university days, long enough to have forgotten a million tiny memories that _Hook Up_ seemed hell-bent on digging up and shoving in my face. From the first scene, the piece is teeming with dramatic irony; we know exactly what's going to happen to Mindy as she unveils her na√Øve expectations of parent-free domestic bliss with her comfort-blanket of a boyfriend.

The party scene put a pit in my stomach, as did everything that came after. Tepperman's libretto is incredible, because it's real. The characters spoke to each other the way I would have, and no one stopped Tepperman from writing in conversations about watching porn as a couple, anal sex, "rules" for one-night-stands, sex on your period, even the embarrassing
