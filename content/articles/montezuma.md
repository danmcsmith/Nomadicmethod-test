* listening to score, there's nothing to suggest the story takes place far, far away - specifically in the New World (at this time of 1733, it was one of the first operas telling a story of the Americas) - maybe that's on purpose (ie., a ruler is a ruler, let's not try and be too exotic about it?) or maybe that's because Vivaldi's style was a draw in itself, and the exotic names and places were enough to pique the audience's interest
* other operas based on the same Moctezuma II: _Motezuma_ by Josef Mysliveček (1771), _Montezuma_ by Carl Heinrich Graun (1755), and _Montezuma_ by Rogers Sessions (1964)
* opera has an exciting biography of its own: the music was thought to be lost after its 1733 premiere (although the libretto survived), and only rediscovered in 2002 by German musicologist Steffen Voss - it was in Berlin's Sing Akademie library, which was taken by the Soviet Red Army after WWII
* it was found incomplete, but since its 2002 rediscovery, the companies who put it up have made judicial cuts/pastes to create a score that works onstage or in-concert
* The opera is a "Baroque equivalent of many a summer movie." - Mark Swed, music critic
* unlikely happy ending in this opera, not based on history, but inspired by the juicy forbidden love story between the Aztec princess Teutile, Motezuma's daughter, and Ramiro, the brother of Cortès, the Spanish conquistador who led the expedition that met Moctezuma and eventually led to the fall of the Aztec empire
* recording done by Il Complesso Barocco, based on reconstruction by Alessandro Ciccolini
