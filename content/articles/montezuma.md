Listening to his score, there's nothing to suggest that Antonio Vivaldi's _Montezuma_ is one of the very first operas set in North America. Composed in 1733, the opera looks far to the West for its exotic appeal, telling the story of Moctezuma II, the 15th- and 16th-century Aztec Emperor who died in 1520 during the Spanish Conquistador expedition led by Hernán Cortés.

When we think of "exotic" operas - _Carmen_, Madama Butterfly, _The Pearl Fishers_ - we often think of a score that reflects the musical aesthetic of somewhere very far away. But Vivaldi's _Montezuma_ - also titled _Motezuma_, in a spelling variance that reflects the many versions of the Aztec's name - sounds like something entirely Italian in origin, as though it could tell a story of a Roman Emperor or deity from Greek Mythology.

Other composers wrote operas based on the the last years of Moctezuma II's life, full of history as they were; Carl Heinrich Graun, a big name in his day among German composers writing Italian opera, wrote his *Montezuma* in 1755, and Czech composer Josef Mysliveček

\***no chorus, has female castrato roles - different from many others of Vivaldi***

\***operas about history but with tons of fiction in it are fascinating, because it makes one wonder what it was about the story that inspired a librettist/composer duo to turn it into an opera at all.***

\***opens up a research rabbit hole for those interested - most of the opera's characters are modeled after real people, even if their stories are fictional***

\***recipe for opera stays the same - forbidden/doomed lovers, chasing happiness against all odds (quote from NYT article about lovers in opera)***

* 
* listening to score, there's nothing to suggest the story takes place far, far away - specifically in the New World (at this time of 1733, it was one of the first operas telling a story of the Americas) - maybe that's on purpose (ie., a ruler is a ruler, let's not try and be too exotic about it?) or maybe that's because Vivaldi's style was a draw in itself, and the exotic names and places were enough to pique the audience's interest
* other operas based on the same Moctezuma II: _Motezuma_ by Josef Mysliveček (1771), _Montezuma_ by Carl Heinrich Graun (1755), and _Montezuma_ by Rogers Sessions (1964)
* opera has an exciting biography of its own: the music was thought to be lost after its 1733 premiere (although the libretto survived), and only rediscovered in 2002 by German musicologist Steffen Voss - it was in Berlin's Sing Akademie library, which was taken by the Soviet Red Army after WWII
* it was found incomplete, but since its 2002 rediscovery, the companies who put it up have made judicial cuts/pastes to create a score that works onstage or in-concert
* The opera is a "Baroque equivalent of many a summer movie." - Mark Swed, music critic
* unlikely happy ending in this opera, not based on history, but inspired by the juicy forbidden love story between the Aztec princess Teutile, Motezuma's daughter, and Ramiro, the brother of Cortès, the Spanish conquistador who led the expedition that met Moctezuma and eventually led to the fall of the Aztec empire
* recording done by Il Complesso Barocco, based on reconstruction by Alessandro Ciccolini
* really difficult arias, as per Vivaldi; coloratura, fast repeated notes (super hard),
