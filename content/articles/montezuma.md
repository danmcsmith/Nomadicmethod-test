* listening to score, there's nothing to suggest the story takes place far, far away - specifically in the New World (at this time of 1733, it was one of the first operas telling a story of the Americas) - maybe that's on purpose (ie., a ruler is a ruler, let's not try and be too exotic about it?) or maybe that's because Vivaldi's style was a draw in itself, and the exotic names and places were enough to pique the audience's interest
* other operas based on the same Moctezuma II: _Motezuma_ by Josef Mysliveƒçek (1771), _Montezuma_ by Carl Heinrich Graun (1755), and _Montezuma_ by Rogers Sessions (1964)
