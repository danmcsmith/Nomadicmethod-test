* The rhythm here **(1)** is about anger. Yes, we're in a recitative, but Verdi's recits still have tempo. It's always a fine line between observing rhythm and giving priority to the text, but I find a good middle-ground is to consider proportions: let us hear the difference between a sixteenth note and a quarter - like in this first line - and you'll find something organic and true to the score.

* Take a smart breath here **(2)**, and give these notes room for vibrato - particularly the first high G.
* This D pitch **(3)** that you keep repeating - it turns into something new when the orchestra comes in on "sa-**r√†**". Check your intonation on the E of "quell'", and sing through both Fs in "angiol".<figure data-type="image"{{% md %}}![](https://res.cloudinary.com/schmopera/image/upload/v1568488868/media/2019/09/AriaGuide-Parmi-p2_wfxeed.png){{% /md %}}

* Try not to over-think these phrases **(4)**. Verdi writes you a crescendo and diminuendo over your line, so let those help you up and down this tricky stepwise motion.
* There's a mood change here **(5)**, his recollection of how Gilda looked. Keep it light here, and don't get caught in the trap of equating dotted sixteenth notes with a fast tempo. When you get to the long melisma on "credo", maintain your vowel. 
* Everyone will have their two cents on how to interpret all these accents **(6)**. Some argue it's about crisp text, others might say it's about giving a rhythmic lead-in for the orchestra. In any case, they're a bit odd to sing, even unfriendly to the voice in that run up to a high A-flat. Pay attention to the first C-natural, and note that it doesn't have an accent; it's a great way to start this phrase lyrically, without hammering right away.

* Be picky with intonation here **(7)**. It's easy to throw away that tiny E-flat, and even easier to be flat on the F of "**l'ar**diva?"
* It's easy here **(8)** to focus on the A-flat, and consider your work done once it's over. The whole line needs care, and it starts with maintaining spin and vibrato on the G-flat, where you first start your descent. The step should be legato and still in tune, both good signs that you're keeping your energy up for the full phrase.

* This melisma **(9)** is certainly one to take to your teacher; different tenors will find their favourite vowel, both at the start and to modify up at the top. The tricky bit, of course, is the semitone between the A-flat and B-double-flat. It will feel quite wide, even for a half-step, and maybe it'll even feel like you're moving from one "place" in your voice to another. A good cue for a job well done: you can still vibrate on the A-flat on your way back down.
