1. The rhythm here is about anger. Yes, we're in a recitative, but Verdi's recits still have tempo. It's always a fine line between observing rhythm and giving priority to the text, but I find a good middle-ground is to consider proportions: let us hear the difference between a sixteenth note and a quarter - like in this first line - and you'll find something organic and true to the score.<figure data-type="image"{{% md %}}![](https://res.cloudinary.com/schmopera/image/upload/v1568488851/media/2019/09/AriaGuide-Parmi-p1_pwtvh8.png){{% /md %}}</figure>
2. Don't get caught without your breath ready here. Take a smart breath, and give these notes room for vibrato - particularly the first high G.
3. This D pitch that you keep repeating - it turns into something new when the orchestra comes in on "sa-**r√†**". Check your intonation on the E of "quell'", and sing through both Fs in "angiol".<figure data-type="image"{{% md %}}![](https://res.cloudinary.com/schmopera/image/upload/v1568488868/media/2019/09/AriaGuide-Parmi-p2_wfxeed.png){{% /md %}}

4. Try not to over-think these phrases. Verdi writes you a crescendo and diminuendo over your line, so let those help you up and down this tricky stepwise motion.
5. There's a mood change here, his recollection of how Gilda looked. Keep it light here, and don't get caught in the trap of equating dotted sixteenth notes with a fast tempo. When you get to the long melisma on "credo", maintain your vowel. <figure data-type="image"{{% md %}}![](https://res.cloudinary.com/schmopera/image/upload/v1568488882/media/2019/09/AriaGuide-Parmi-p3_o6o7h8.png){{% /md %}}
