"He was master of the score's details and the orchestra played superbly for him."

American conductor [Stephen Lord](http://parkartists.com/web/design/artists/conductors/portfolio/stephen_lord/index.html) comes back to Toronto early this year, and we're excited. He'll conduct _Un ballo in maschera_ at the Canadian Opera Company, opening [February 2nd](http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/1314Season/UnBalloInMaschera.aspx); after his stunning _Lucia di Lammermoor_ last year, that's a lot to look forward to. Lord is one of four conductors named in _Opera News' _"25 Most Powerful Names in U.S. Opera," and he can be seen on podiums at San Francisco Opera, Boston Lyric Opera, Lyric Opera of Chicago, Opera Theater St. Louis, Wolf Trap Opera and Opéra de Montreal. We had the chance to chat last year, and he spoke about working with young singers, conducting opera, and about the power of live theatre. It's just the kind of timeless wisdom and big grin you'd expect. Enjoy!
