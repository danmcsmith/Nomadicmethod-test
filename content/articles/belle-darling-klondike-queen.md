Toronto's Alumnae Theatre is in the midst of its [2019 FireWorks Festival](https://www.alumnaetheatre.com/fireworks-festival.html), which puts up three new plays by three Canadian women. I caught the first chapter, Natalie Frijia's _Belle Darling Klondike Queen_; it's not just a historical vaudeville hoot, but it's as different as it could be from the other two on the line-up - the social-media tragedy of Crystal Wood's _Grief Circus_, and the feminist-Cinderella of _If the Shoe Fits_.
