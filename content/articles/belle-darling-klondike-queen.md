Toronto's Alumnae Theatre is in the midst of its [2019 FireWorks Festival](https://www.alumnaetheatre.com/fireworks-festival.html), which puts up three new plays by three Canadian women. I caught the first chapter, Natalie Frijia's [_Belle Darling Klondike Queen_](https://www.alumnaetheatre.com/belle-darling-klondike-queen.html); it's not just a historical vaudeville hoot, but it's as different as it could be from the other two on the line-up - the social-media tragedy of Crystal Wood's [_Grief Circus_](https://www.alumnaetheatre.com/grief-circus.html), and the feminist-Cinderella of [_If the Shoe Fits_](https://www.alumnaetheatre.com/if-the-shoe-fits.html).

_Belle Darling Klondike Queen_ is named for Kathleen Rockwell, the dancer and vaudeville star of the Klondike Gold Rush. Up in Alaska and the Yukon during the height of the Rush - just after the so-called ["stampede"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klondike_Gold_Rush#Beginning_of_the_stampede_(July_1897)) of 1897-98 - Rockwell was known as Klondike Kate. 

Klondike Kate was one of the few folks - and even fewer women - who prospered, at least for a time, during the Gold Rush. She was a star of the Savoy Theatrical Company in Dawson City, Yukon, her work wavering in the grey areas between onstage performer and offstage companion to the male miners, far from home and in search of fortune. She was tough and brave by anyone's standards, let alone as a woman entrepreneur in the turn-of-the-century Canadian Arctic.

Natalie Frijia creates a real force in the Klondike Kate we meet in _Belle Darling Klondike Queen_, and Lindsay Sutherland Boal delivers in the title role. _Belle Darling_ is done entirely in vaudeville style - songs and all - Sutherland Boal leading her supportive, adaptive, hilarious ensemble of three (Sarah Kaufmann, Madeleine Keesmaat-Walsh, and Roxhanne Norman).

The vaudeville through-line is brilliant. On the surface, it's a reminder that putting on a variety show takes major skill; it's another layer of being wowed by Klondike Kate (and Sutherland Boal, frankly), that she can not only survive in a corset in the Yukon, but put on a great show night after night. 

And it's a way for us to get nothing but great stories from a truly charismatic woman. Kate does that arresting, amazing, rare thing onstage, where she makes friends with her audience, and overshares in a beautiful way. 

We learn about her adventures, her face-offs with mountains and men, and her near-insane love for the stage - her stories really are the kind to make you lean in and listen. We learn that she's smart, aware of the grey areas inherent in her work; if she ever ever sold those miners more than her stage presence, she did it by choice, goddammit.
