We love everything about this video. Austrian death metal band [Dead Territory](http://www.deadterritory.at/) has recorded John Cage's *4'33"*, including their own original intro. It's a great mix of respectful and funny (is it supposed to be funny? Maybe that's part of the [aleatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleatoric_music)). Kudos to these guys for staying true to their own style, for honouring the piece's three movements, and for sheer straight-faced commitment.

To be clear, their *4'33"* cover is a pretty big departure from their own music. Check them out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/deadterritory)), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/DeadTerritoryMetal/), and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/deadterritory).
