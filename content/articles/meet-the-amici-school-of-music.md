Toronto-based singers [Leigh-Ann Allen](/scene/people/leigh-ann-allen/) and [Michelle Garlough](/scene/people/michelle-garlough/) are the founders of the [Amici School of Music](http://amicimusicschool.com/). The school offers private lessons as well as Music Together® classes for kids 0-5 years old (and their parents). When they're not teaching, Leigh and Michelle are active performers on the opera stage. I asked them how they do it all, and how their teaching has informed their own singing.
