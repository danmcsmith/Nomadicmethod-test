If you're like me, and you enjoy spending time on your own, you'll understand this dilemma: do you take yourself out on a date for one - to the movies, or to a nice dinner, a place where you're unlikely to have the social safety blanket of a laptop or book, or do you bring a friend on your outing, so as not to appear so utterly, suspiciously, publicly _alone_?

It's a silly thing, but even the most hardcore of introverts struggle with the idea that while they sit happily alone at a table or in a movie theatre, the people around them will notice and think they're a weird loner. 

But going to the opera, all on one's own, is totally fabulous. 

Unlike going to a restaurant, which essentially leaves a large, empty container of time that's traditionally meant for groups to converse and try each other's food, a night at the opera is beautifully structured for a solo ticket holder.

I've thought for a while that going to the opera is an awesome thing to do on a date - even an early date, when you're still getting to know someone. There's an excuse to get a little dressed up and enjoy some pre-show booze to calm the nerves; plus, there's the comforting structure of designated conversation time - once the show starts, both of you get to shut up for a bit.

Hopefully the show itself is good, but it doesn't really matter; there's as much conversation fodder to be found in operas that are jaw-dropping as there is in productions that fall flat. If both of you are opera fans, it's a no-brainer; if only one of you is, it's a chance to introduce something new to another person - one of those (hopefully) fun parts of dating. And if neither of you is opera-initiated, then you're both trying out something new together.

It's maybe a bit more of an investment than dinner and a movie, but I do think live theatre - and since I'm a nut for it, opera - makes for a great date. But often what's even greater than going as a pair, is going to the opera completely solo.

There are a few activities - dining, going to a bar, even the movies - that are a bit scary to do on one's own. For those with normal levels of social anxiety, it's a bit unnerving to imagine sitting at a table for one for an entire meal. It's like a large, empty container of time that's meant to be spent conversing with a dining buddy or trying each other's food - not wondering if the server thinks you're weird or if the other people in the restaurant think you got stood up.

But going to the opera has structure, a rhythm to the evening; the time is compartmentalized into small chunks - arrival, pre-show, show, intermission, show, exit. And the solo opera-goer gets to decide how to spend each bit of time.

You're allowed to show up at any point between when the doors open (say, 30-60 minutes before the show), leaving as much or as little of the free-rein lobby mingling as you'd like. There's usually a bar, meaning you can do that thing where you put a beverage in your hands and you feel much more normal in public. Or, you can bee-line it right to your seat and get your pre-show reading done, uninterrupted.

At intermission, you can boot it to the washroom, or the bar, or both - and you can do it faster flying solo.

The same goes for the post-show exodus: ***

When I go to the opera alone, I always love most the moment when the house lights dim to signal the show's imminent start. It's a little bit like the show is happening just for me; I don't have to nod in agreement when my opera date is impressed by the set, or mirror their enthusiastic applause after an aria if I'm just not feeling it.
