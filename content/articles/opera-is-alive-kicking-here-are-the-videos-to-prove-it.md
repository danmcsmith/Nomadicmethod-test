If you're up on your web-based opera, you might know soprano Jessica Fishenfeld from the hilarious short, [_Something Blue: The Bachelor Opera_](/something-blue-the-bachelor-opera/). Now, she's back on YouTube with a mission to do right by American opera in her new web series, [_Alive & Kicking_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrxMALrY4cM).
