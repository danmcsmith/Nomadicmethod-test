preamble = "Because they're both fantastic, the legendary soprano Beverly Sills teamed up with actor/comedian/singer Danny Kaye, for a hilarious parody bit on all things opera. Sills and Kaye trade short clips of some of opera's most famous tunes. I love this kind of stuff, because it shows that a) Kaye knows his stuff (he actually conducted a few orchestras in his lifetime, with varying degrees of seriousness) and b) Sills is all skill, no ego. Enjoy!"
