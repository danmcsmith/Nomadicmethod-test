Every September, Chicagoans flock to Millennium Park for the annual _Stars of the Lyric Opera_ concert. This year, unseasonably cool weather in The Loop meant lugging sweaters, hats, and warm blankets along with the customary lawn chairs and wine coolers. Friday's concert featured enticing excerpts from seven operas from the Lyric's upcoming season along with other crowd-pleasing favorites. 

It was a delightful evening of music from the moment Music Director Sir Andrew Davis sprung onto the podium. Davis, always a charming presence, conducted the Lyric Opera Orchestra and the Lyric Opera Chorus with aplomb. The chorus, prepared by Michael Black, contributed three rousing numbers: "Ad Arturo onore" from Bellini's _I puritani_, "L'Amour triomphe" from Gluck's _Orphée et Eurydice_, and -apparently just for fun - "Vot tak syurpriz!" from Tchaikovsky's _Eugene Onegin_. 

An early highlight of the evening was Lauren Snouffer's beautifully sweet "Deh vieni," Susanna's aria from _Le nozze di Figaro_. While the opera is not on the Lyric's upcoming docket, (this season's Mozart offering will be _Così fan tutte_ in March), it made for a lovely concert-opener and it was a treat to hear Snouffer's stylish, warm voice ahead of her performance later this month as Amour in Gluck's _Orphée et Eurydice_. 

Among the concert's brilliant soloists was the captivating Janai Brugger, who will have her house debut this season as Liù in _Turandot_. Brugger sang Liù's devastating aria "Tu che di gel sei cinta" and Marguerite's playful Jewel Song, "Ah, je ris de me voir si belle," from Faust; two very different arias that showcased Brugger's plummy lyric soprano.

Another LOC newcomer, Russian tenor Dmitry Korchak, is set to debut very soon as Orphée in _Orphée et Eurydice_ and gave the audience a preview with a performance of the tragic, (and fiendishly difficult) "J'ai perdu mon Eurydice." Korchak's polished, distinctive tenor was also featured in a set from Faust's _Werther_, during which he romanced the crowd with a stirring rendition of "Pourquoi me réveiller." While he's not set to perform that role at the Lyric this season, I very much look forward to hearing his Orphée in a few short weeks.

The highlight of the evening for me was Matthew Polenzani and Anthony Clark Evans singing the famous tenor/baritone duet from Bizet's _The Pearl Fishers_. This was old-school opera glamour and Polenzani's elegant tenor found a lovely match in Clark Evans' rich, easy baritone. _The Pearl Fishers_, with Polenzani as Nadir, comes to LOC in a new-to-Chicago production at the end of November. 

The most highly-anticipated offering came at the end of the evening: a sampling of _Die Walküre_, which will arrive on the Lyric stage in November as Part Two of the company's ongoing four-year roll-out of a new production of Wagner's epic tetralogy, _Der Ring des Nibelungen_. After the requisite orchestral rendition of _Ride of the Valkyries_, a stoic Eric Owens delivered a powerful and nuanced performance of Wotan's "Leb' wohl." Owens will continue his role debut as Wotan with this season's _Walküre_, following a triumphant initial turn as the corrupt King of the Gods in last season's _Rheingold_.
