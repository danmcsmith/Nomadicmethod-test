If there's ever a safe bet to be made, it's that hearing a live performance of a Mahler symphony will conjure up true catharsis. The Toronto Symphony Orchestra just finished three performances of Mahler's Symphony No. 2 - titled "Resurrection"; when I confirmed my plans to attend, I felt an acute sensation of confidence that my night out at Roy Thomson Hall would be impactful.

So confident was I that I almost took it for granted; so, when Mahler's music began, it was as though it dragged me by the nape of my neck through an emotional rollercoaster I didn't know I needed.

Mahler's "Resurrection" Symphony is a study in drama without words. Of course, there are words - they come nearly an hour into the work's roughly 80 minutes; by the time we hear the text written for the fourth and fifth movements - including the famed "Urlicht" ("Primeval Light") - we're so wrung out that it's like a balm, like finally confiding our troubles in someone else after bearing the weight of it ourselves.

I think it's all the hope in this symphony that makes it so moving. 

* hopeful message, exposes the need for humans to feel immortal and still connected to their lost ones
* the message is like watching someone try not to cry
