Joel Ivany, artistic director of [Against the Grain Theatre](http://againstthegraintheatre.com/), has had a pretty wild year. Just this week, he won a Dora Award with _Figaro's Wedding_  for Outstanding New Musical/Opera, and closed a sold-out run of _[Pelléas et Mélisande](/in-review-pelleas-et-melisande/)._ Next, he'll be heading out to the extraordinarily beautiful Banff Centre to work on his latest piece, _#UncleJohn_, at the Open Space Program. I caught up with Joel to ask him about the program, about adapting a serious classic like Mozart's _Don Giovanni_, and why _#UncleJohn_ is a piece that sends opera forward.

Stay tuned to meet the rest of the _#UncleJohn_ creative team, and to catch what's happening during our time in Banff. Click [here for details about the shows](https://www.facebook.com/events/1494928980723400/?ref=br_tf), running August 1-3, 2014 at the Cave and Basin National Historic Site.
