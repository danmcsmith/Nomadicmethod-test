A portable practice focused largely on breath, it's no wonder why opera singers are such fans of yoga. Canadian soprano [Layla Claire](/talking-with-singers-layla-claire/) is one of those singers who swears by yoga as part of her daily warm-up; if you've ever heard her sing, it's clear that her warm-up routine is serving her very well.

We wanted to share this short video profile on Claire, created by yoga-giant Lululemon. She filmed it this past summer in Salzburg, where she sang Donna Elvira in *Don Giovanni* with Ildebrando D'Arcangelo and Luca Pisaroni. She reprises Elvira in March at [Opernhaus ZÃ¼rich](http://www.opernhaus.ch/en/activity/detail/don-giovanni-11-03-2017-18634/), before singing the Countess in Opera Philadelphia's [*Le nozze di Figaro*.](https://www.operaphila.org/whats-on/)

The rehearsal clips in the video are from *La finta giardiniera* at Festival D'Aix-en-Provence, 2012, with baritone John Chest.
