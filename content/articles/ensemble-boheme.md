The Canadian Opera Company's production of _La bohème_ has been running smoothly, in the able hands of two casts. On Wednesday night, yet another group of singers stepped into the iconic roles of Puccini's bohemian tragedy, in a special (and free) performance that's part of the COC's new Opera for Toronto initiative.

Each year, the COC sets aside a night to show off the young artists of the Ensemble Studio; historically, these have been as a gala-type showcase or a special production of their own. Last year's foray into the gala format didn't really do it for me, so I was pleased to see the COC return to what seems like the best option: a unique performance of an ongoing mainstage production, cast as thoroughly as possible with young artists.

John Caird's Toulouse Lautrec-inspired production of _La bohème_ is a good vehicle for COC Ensemble Studio members Samuel Chan (Marcello), Joel Allison (Schaunard), Lauren Margison (Mimì), and Lauren Eberwein (Musetta); also onstage were Ensemble graduates Andrew Haji (Rodolfo), Neil Craighead (Colline), and Doug MacNaughton (Benoît/Alcindoro).

The whole thing seemed very _This Is Your Life_. The stage was filled not just with so-called young artists, but with the current faces of Canada's opera scene. It was a very welcome thing to hear Haji's Rodolfo and Craighead's Colline; both singers have spent years with these roles, and they sound beautifully ingrained and organic. MacNaughton is a riot onstage, and it's good to be reminded of that.

The four Ensemble Studio singers all took on roles that, on first thought, seemed like an odd fit. 

\#OperaForToronto

* cast filled with young artists, and faces of Toronto
* everyone sounds fab, four guys are all singing well
* this is your life, opera edition
* the COC historically makes a whole thing out of these shows, too many cooks, disproportional prep for a single show
* Neil and Joel a hoot to watch in Act II
