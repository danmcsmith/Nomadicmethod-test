The Canadian Opera Company's production of _La boh√®me_ has been running smoothly, in the able hands of two casts. On Wednesday night, yet another group of singers stepped into the iconic roles of Puccini's bohemian tragedy, in a special (and free) performance that's part of the COC's new Opera for Toronto initiative.

Each year, the COC sets aside a night to show off the young artists of the Ensemble Studio; historically, these have been as a gala-type showcase or a special production of their own. Last year's foray into the gala format didn't really do it for me, so I was pleased to see the COC return to what seems like the best option: a unique performance of an ongoing mainstage production, cast as thoroughly as possible with young artists.

COC Ensemble Studio members Samuel Chan, Joel Allison, Lauren Margison, and Lauren Eberwein

* cast filled with young artists, and faces of Toronto
* everyone sounds fab, four guys are all singing well
* this is your life, opera edition
* the COC historically makes a whole thing out of these shows, too many cooks, disproportional prep for a single show
* Neil and Joel a hoot to watch in Act II
