Canadian soprano, conductor, and general Renaissance woman [Barbara Hannigan](/scene/people/barbara-hannigan/) has been on my mind lately, largely because she's in Toronto [October 7th and 8th](http://www.tso.ca/en-ca/concerts-and-tickets/2015-2016-Season/EventDetails/Barbara-Hannigan-Sings-Conducts.aspx) to conduct and to sing with the Toronto Symphony Orchestra. Hannigan's website has tons of [video gems](http://www.barbarahannigan.com/watch/opera-concert-videos/) available to view, one of which stuck out as a must-share.

Larry Weinstein directs Hannigan and Mark McKinney (*Kids in the Hall*) in *Toothpaste*, a soap opera by Alexina Louie and Dan Redican. Hannigan does her own singing, of course, and McKinney's "voice" is provided by Canadian baritone [Doug MacNaughton](/scene/people/doug-macnaughton/); [Alex Pauk](/scene/people/alex-pauk/) conducts the [Esprit Orchestra](http://www.espritorchestra.com/index.html). The story is simple: woman gets lazy when it comes to screwing the cap back on the toothpaste, and man is upset about it. Now *that's* relevant art.

There's also the sequel, [*Burnt Toast*](https://youtu.be/2DrN57bRe4Y), also a must-see. It's the 8th episode in Louie and Redican's series of shorts by the same name, which is about the highs and lows of romantic love. *Burnt Toast* is where we found the episode with [Colin Mochrie lip-syncing to Russell Braun](/colin-mochrie-russell-braun-and-operagrams/) while wielding a leaf blower.
