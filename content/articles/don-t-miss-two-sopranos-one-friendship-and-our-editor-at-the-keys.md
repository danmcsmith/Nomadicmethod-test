Readers, we've got a rare opportunity for you:

On **June 2, 7pm** at St. John's United Church in Oakville, you can catch a handful of Canada's excellent talent in recital. Sopranos - and best friends - Aviva Fortunata and Claire de Sévigné present _Two Sopranos, One Friendship_, a concert that celebrates high notes, illicit duets, and comedy banter to rival the days of Carol Burnett and Julie Andrews.

Plus! At the piano is Jenna Simeonov (me), founder and editor of Schmopera. Out and about and likely wearing lipstick.

Tickets are $40, and you can get them by emailing [office@stjohnsunited.ca](mailto:office@stjohnsunited.ca), or at the door.

We'd love to see you there!
