It's good to be back, readers. Not just back, but improved: for a short while, we handed the Schmopera reins over to our superb man behind the scenes, Andrej, who has given the site a makeover from the inside out - thanks for noticing!

The technical work gave us little choice except to take a luxurious bit of vacation from writing (no complaints); still, we were out and about, catching shows and saving our notes for the New Year.

Gregory Finney, our formidable Toronto contributor, caught the latest presentation by the fledgling Tongue In Cheek Productions, **_Verbotenlieder_**. Canada's female operatic talent filled Lula Lounge to sing a ballsy selection of arias and duets traditionally reserved for the gentlemen; Greg calls it, "the kind of evening out I hope we see a lot more of in 2019."

"This neat musical earplay was probably most present with the Pearl Fishers and Rodolfo and Marcello's duet from _La bohème_, sung beautifully by soprano Vanessa Oude-Reimerink and mezzo-soprano Alexandra Beley." Greg's highlights included Brittany Cann's _Don Quichotte à Dulcinée_ ("Dear Toronto, this is a voice to watch."), and Lauren Margison's appropriation of tenor arias from _Madama Butterfly_ and _Turandot_.

"Natalya Gennadi sang Lensky's Aria from _Eugene Onegin_, and if you missed it, I'm sorry for you. I'd would say it was some of the best singing I heard this year, not just this night."

Greg caught the verboten, and I saw the traditional. The Toronto Symphony Orchestra sounded particularly Canadian in its holiday run of Handel's **_Messiah_**, which featured home grown soloists Claire de Sévigné, Allyson McHardy, Andrew Haji, and Tyler Duncan. COC Music Director Johannes Debus brought operatic flair to Handel's score, peppering it with surprises enough to keep a very, _very_ familiar score sounding new.
