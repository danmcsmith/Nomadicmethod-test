Minnesota operas most recent production of Rossini's _Il barbiere di Siviglia_ opened last weekend at the Ordway Center for the Performing Arts. Husband and wife team [Daniela Mack](/talking-with-singers-daniela-mack/) and [Alek Shrader](/scene/people/alek-shrader/) starred as Rosina and Count Almaviva. Ms. Mack provided strong low notes, with a sassy and empowered portrayal of Rosina that extended beyond her first aria "Una voce poco fa".  Often, Rosinas don't carry the passion through the lengthy opera. 

There were many laughs of the evening, aided by the well coordinated antics of the male chorus. As Berta, Resident Artist [Danielle Beckvermit](https://mnopera.org/biography/danielle-beckvermit/) was memorable as a snuff-taking, hysterical sidekick to Dr. Bartolo. (Her trademark was random screams and carrying around a rachet instrument to swing in a threatening manner towards Rosina and the Count.) Her aria was lovely treble interlude in an opera filled with rapid fire Italian and smoky bass and mezzo solos. (Side note: every time I see this opera, I am kind of surprised by the number of bass-baritones on stage.)

The absolute highlight of the show is the title character, Figaro sung by Rodion Pogosso. After the first scene the energy was lagging (I attended the Sunday matinee after opening night, so  it is very understandable that everyone was a little tired), Mr. Pogossov made his grand entrance for his signature aria, "Largo al factotum", from the front of the mezzanine. He really let it rip. His boisterous baritone rang in the hall as he showed off his bravado and soft shoe skills. 

Director Francesca Zambello made an addition to the story by having a child actor play a silent role of Figaro's assistant. It was a comical and fresh addition to the opera. Dr. Bartolo was sung by \[Patrick Carfizzi\] (https://www.patrickcarfizzi.com/) and \[Andrew Gilstrap\] (https://mnopera.org/biography/andrew-gilstrap/) as Basilio.

Props must be given to Minnesota Opera for scheduling this family-friendly fan favorite, the seats were certainly filled. Hopefully the next generation of opera goers were hooked during this brief run! 

I look forward to _Flight_ in January 2020.
