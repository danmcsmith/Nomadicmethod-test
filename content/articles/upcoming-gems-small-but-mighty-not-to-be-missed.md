This spring, opera fans in Toronto can expect some lighter fare to go with the warming weather.

On **May 1, 7pm** at Lula Lounge, check out the latest from Tongue in Cheek Productions: [_Democracy in Action_](https://www.tongueincheekproductions.com/democracyinaction). Though the title feels timely, the political stakes aren't costly with this night of singing. The audience holds the power here - with the help of online polls, and a "wide array of eclectic selections", listeners can cast their vote and hear the results. 

For [_Democracy in Action_](https://www.tongueincheekproductions.com/democracyinaction), TiC has gathered a solid line-up of Canadian talent, including Teiya Kasahara, Krisztina Szabó and Julie Nesrallah. 

Doors open at 6:30, and the show begins at 7pm. Seating is guaranteed with a dinner reservation. Find out more by calling Lula Lounge at (416) 588-0307.
