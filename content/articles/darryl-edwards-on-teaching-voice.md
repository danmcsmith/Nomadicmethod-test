[Darryl Edwards](http://darryledwards.ca/) is an Associate Professor of Voice at the [University of Toronto](https://www.music.utoronto.ca/), and Artistic Director of the [Centre for Opera Studies in Italy](http://www.co-si.com/) (COSI). He was kind enough to chat with me about why he teaches, about training young singers in Italy, and what he defines as "good singing." Enjoy!
