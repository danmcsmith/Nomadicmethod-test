3. Get a head start (see: come in early) with the rolled R in "Ritorna", so you can be really singing that pick-up E-flat. This is a big, sweeping phrase, and those really only work when every single note is sung. Puccini helps you with the _portamento_ in the word "Ritorna", where you can ride the spin of one vowel to connect two pitches. Pay attention to your vowels (are they morphing into something weird?) and your vibrato (does it tend to stop and start?) - and most importantly, be diligent about intonation on those G-flats.

4. More intonation stuff here: the space between this E-flat and the D-natural is way smaller than you think. It's easy to fall flat on the D, so make sure you're still spinning sound on that pitch.

5. Don't work too hard for this low stuff. Puccini clears away the orchestra and marks it _col canto_; you can sing these short phrases at a comfortable volume, and let them be a speech-like, matter-of-fact moment to clear our palate before the lyric stuff coming next.

6. This is some of that Puccini irony: he gets almost finnicky with his tempo markings - a _ritardando_, then _col canto_, also a _ritenuto_ - but if everyone follows them, the musical effect is spontaneous and organic. It's handy to think of really observing the comma between the two "ascolta" statements; let the _ritenuto_ be a chance for you to sing two distinct \[a\] vowels, one to finish the first "ascolta", the next to start the second one.

   Last detail: be ready for the _a tempo_ to hit, and don't be late on "le poche...".
7. If you make sure you're singing legato in this measure, it'll be easier to do the staccato
