Some Sunday fun for you, readers!

We liken this video by Juan Pablo Zaramella to every production of *La bohème*. Every time we weep (either at the return of the *cuffietta*, or when Musetta is nice, or at the very least at "coraggio!"), we feel like yelling at long-dead Puccini, "you did not earn those tears honourably! These are cheap tricks!"

And still, we love *La bohème*. And onions.
