We're big fans of Louis CK's, and we couldn't resist sharing this clip from his very funny *Live at the Comedy Store*. We can't help but wonder if the story is true (sounds kinda true-ish, knowing how young opera singers can be), and if we know this girl on the New York City subway. Does she go to Juilliard? MSM? The curiosity is in overdrive.
