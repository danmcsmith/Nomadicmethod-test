American singer [Jennifer Holloway](http://www.jenniferhollowaymezzo.com/jenniferhollowaymezzo.com/Home.html) is currently in Toronto, all set to make her Canadian Opera Company debut as Donna Elvira in Dmitri Tcherniakov's [Don Giovanni](http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/1415Season/DonGiovanni.aspx), which opens January 24th. She was kind enough to sit down with me and talk about the character of Donna Elvira, about sympathizing with the Don, and about Mozart's sense of feminism. She's delightful and smart, and I can't wait to hear her on the Four Seasons Centre stage. Enjoy!
