ound as well as the magnificent and rare sound of the bass-flute as the representation of the piper’s magical music.

The singing was extremely accomplished from both soprano Amu Komsi and contralto Helena Rasker. Komsi, for whom this role was written, had a clear and astonishingly versatile voice. Pushed to the very limits of her range, she gave a performance that was full of charisma and surprise. I did feel however, that she may have pushed the envelope a little too far and could have kept the performance a little more contained; could have sung more as opposed to demonstrating. There was a marked difference in the way Rasker handled the performance though both performers brought their own unique qualities to the stage. In the role of the Minister Rasker was grounded and stoic with a sound that was powerful yet controlled.

The three pieces that formed the first half of the programme complimented the opera perfectly. First up was the UK premiere of Australian composer Cathy Milliken’s ensemble piece _Bright Ring_. Inspired by her previous work with Ensemble Modern and the vitality that comes from collaboration, the energy of this piece was palpable. It was a collection of improvisational moments of growth followed by dissipation. Overwhelming moments of activity with highly percussive strings were broken by a thinning of the texture and a general feeling of release in repeated patterns over and over again. But always present was the evocative storytelling and grandeur of the piece.

English composer Christian Mason’s _Layers of Love_ (2015) was an exploration of the feeling of longing for the unknown. It had a searching quality as it hovered in and around the tonic, each instrument stood alone in a cacophonous sea of sound like the many “voices” in one’s head, all vying for attention. The sense of rhythmic pulse that came in by the second half of the piece felt like a welcoming familiarity after the tenuous chaos. In a short amount of time Mason created a journey from beginning to end while maximizing the limits of instrumental potential.

Finally, we heard Dallapiccola’s _Piccola musica notturna_. A master of mid-century serialism, Dallapiccola’s music can somehow feel slightly off-kilter and yet so surreally beautiful all at once. His 12-tone writing was uniquely lyrical and in the case of this piece, featured a warm, rounded instrumentation of harp, strings, celeste, and woodwinds. It was evocative, atmospheric, and often like most good things, over too soon.

This was an example of intelligent, thoughtful programming, a wonderful way to showcase Ensemble Modern, and an opportunity to feature the work George Benjamin, a true household name by now. It is rare that new music concerts of this scale are so well attended, and it was a joy to see so many people appreciating and learning from this exciting repertoire. It was certainly well received and very rightly so.
