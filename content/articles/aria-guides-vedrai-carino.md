* Something to keep in mind right from the start **(1)**: Zerlina has grown up a little since the last aria she sang ("Batti, batti"). She's lived more, and likely learned a bit about her body since her encounter with the Don. It's a bit similar to what a Susanna would feel in _Le nozze di Figaro_, when she arrives at "Deh vieni, non tardar". Zerlina's aria too has a nobility and a maturity about it, a roominess that we don't often associate with soubrette roles. The 3/8 time will give the tune a swinging feel of 1, but stay on the voice as you sustain each pitch. There's time to be deliberate, even with the grace notes in the melody.

* Super connected legato here **(2)**. Give a bit of a double N to "naturale", to help with the language. In the next bar, make a clear choice to sing the E more loudly than the D - essentially, a really obvious diminuendo.

* There's something about this phrase **(3)** that makes people sing sharp. Often, the issue is that you're breathing before "non dà..." and then again before "e lo...", so you're uncomfortably stacking air. You can likely make it through with one breath, if you bring your vibrato around to every note. When you get to that "no" at the end of the line, give it a double N.
* You'll likely take the breath one breath before this "far" **(4)**, and aim at least for the end of "balsamo" before they breathe again. You'll be fine if you plan accordingly. Some folks like to slow a bit on the way into "È un certo...", so you'll need to account for that, too. It sometimes helps to imagine, in the word "far", that the \[a\] vowel happens in the same place as the letter F.

* Text makes this spot **(5)** fun to sing. There are rhythmic shifts and neat hemiolas to be found if you really prioritize the rhythm of the Italian, which puts the stress on the first syllable of "dove". Really try overdoing the difference between the stressed and unstressed syllables, and you'll find the coy cleverness that Mozart gives to Zerlina. One last note: the fermata on the last "sta?" is only written for the first note (E), not the D in the next bar.

* The way you come in here **(6)** is in mid-phrase with the orchestra, all of you resolving at "quà". It can be really effective (and affective, even) to start "Toccami" gently, joining the melody already in place. Then at all the shouts of "sentilo battere", lean again on the Italian rhythm to make this phrase exciting. Italians say, "**Sen**-ti-lo", so try putting that into Mozart's rhythms - it'll be fun, trust me.
