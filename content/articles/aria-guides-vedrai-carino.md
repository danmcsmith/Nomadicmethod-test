* Something to keep in mind right from the start **(1)**: Zerlina has grown up a little since the last aria she sang ("Batti, batti"). She's lived more, and likely learned a bit about her body since her encounter with the Don. It's a bit similar to what a Susanna would feel in _Le nozze di Figaro_, when she arrives at "Deh vieni, non tardar". Zerlina's aria too has a nobility and a maturity about it, a roominess that we don't often associate with soubrette roles. The 3/8 time will give the tune a swinging feel of 1, but stay on the voice as you sustain each pitch. There's time to be deliberate, even with the grace notes in the melody.

* Super connected legato here **(2)**. Give a bit of a double N to "naturale", to help with the language. In the next bar, make a clear choice to sing the E more loudly than the D - essentially, a really obvious diminuendo.

* There's something about this phrase **(3)** that makes people sing sharp. Often, the issue is that you're breathing before "non d√†..." and then again before "e lo...", so you're uncomfortably stacking air. You can likely make it through with one breath, if you bring your vibrato around to every note. When you get to that "no" at the end of the line, give it a double N.
