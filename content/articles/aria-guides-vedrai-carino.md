* Something to keep in mind right from the start **(1)**: Zerlina has grown up a little since the last aria she sang ("Batti, batti"). She's lived more, and likely learned a bit about her body since her encounter with the Don. It's a bit similar to what a Susanna would feel in _Le nozze di Figaro_, when she arrives at "Deh vieni, non tardar". Zerlina's aria too has a nobility and a maturity about it, a roominess that we don't often associate with soubrette roles. The 3/8 time will give the tune a swinging feel of 1, but stay on the voice as you sustain each pitch. There's time to be deliberate, even with the grace notes in the melody.
