Happy New Year! I'm starting 2015 off light, with a fun opera find out in the world of general media. Did you know actress/comedienne Retta, who plays Donna on *Parks and Recreation*, trained as an opera singer? She's still got some decent chops, too, which she showed off to Conan O'Brien in 2012. *NSFW warning: light profanity.
