Readers, the future now, and it's apparently been now for years. It happens more and more with age: you look away for what seems like a second, and all of a sudden there are holograms giving concerts. Holograms, people. They're out there, giving posthumous live (?) performances that seem to touch the nerves of both fandom and nostalgia. "Elvis", "Tupac", and "Nat King Cole" have all resurrected themselves for a latest swan song for a packed crowd; just this year, ["Roy Orbison"](https://noisey.vice.com/en_au/article/wj37ab/hologram-concerts-dont-suck-youre-just-a-hater) went on an international tour, as did opera's very own ["Maria Callas"](http://operawire.com/bringing-maria-callas-back-to-life-the-team-behind-callas-in-concert-on-creating-a-hologram-of-la-divina/). 

Opera fans are famous for digging in their heels and resisting the new stuff, so I'm sure there are folks out there who are fundamentally, ideologically opposed to the idea of hearing a hologram sing an aria. If that's the hill an opera fanatic wants to die on - and perhaps come back as a hologram and denounce it some more - so be it.

But the simple truth is that, particularly for young opera lovers, a new - well, old - generation is now available to us. Those born after 1977 can hear Callas "live"; the unfortunate among us who never heard Pavarotti live can come pretty darn close in hologram form. Joan Sutherland, Beverly Sills, Maureen Forrester, Cornell MacNeil: all of these singers of the past, whose prime years were luckily captured on video, are now, for all intents and purposes, back in the mix.

We can now play a fantasy-football-like game of imagining the opera cast of our dreams. What would it be like to hear Christine Goerke sing Brünnhilde opposed Jon Vickers' Siegfried? Or to hear _La fille du régiment_ with Javier Camarena and Beverly Sills? Marilyn Horne's Adalgisa with Sondra Radvanovsky's Norma? 

Or! _Don Carlo_, with Plácido Domingo's hologram in the title role, and the real-life Plácido Domingo as Rodrigo? Add a little Jamie Barton as Eboli, and Nicolai Ghiaurov as Philip II? Yum.
