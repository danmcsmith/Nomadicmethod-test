### How does Scarlatti's _La caduta de' Decemviri_ tell the story of Virginia, and how is his telling different from Botticelli's?

Scarlatti sets a libretto by Silvio Stampiglia from 1697 that is directly based on Livy's original telling of the story of Virginia in Book III of his History of Rome.  This being opera, Stampiglia has concocted a happy ending!

Botticelli's painting takes a few key episodes of the story, which would have been well-known to his viewers, and presents them in the same painting. He created his “Story of Virginia” as a partner to his “Rape of Lucretia,” which Isabella Stewart Gardner purchased in 1899—the first Botticelli in America.

### Why do you think Isabella Stewart Gardner was so drawn to depictions of strong, complex (and in this case, martyred) women?

Isabella lived at a time when women typically had little freedom or agency.  So she adopted a course of action to achieve both—a remarkable achievement.  She shaped her world and her persona to give herself leeway to pursue her own vision—and Boston, and the world, are the richer for it. It is no wonder that she was drawn to, among other things, depictions of strong women from the past.

The stories of Lucretia and Virgina, gruesome and tragic, were seen by audiences of the Renaissance as stories of women's battles against tyranny.

The Renaissance writer Giovanni Fiorentino, writing in his  Pecorone of 1378, put it thus:  "Even as the city was delivered from tyranny . . . through the death of Lucretia, so the death of Virginia liberated the state from ten tyrants  \[the Decemviri\]."

The stories of these women's heroic battles seem particularly apt and poignant at present. Botticelli’s paintings illustrate these alarming and urgent stories with vividness.

### What do you hope audiences will take away from this pairing of Scarlatti and Botticelli?

We hope this performance helps to bring Scarlatti's unknown opera to light, helps share the little-known story of Virginia to life, and helps to illuminate the ongoing relevance of Virginia's story in the present day, especially women’s central role in the fight against tyranny from the earliest times to the present.
