Eight years later, and the rent is still too damn high.

By all operatic accounts, Against the Grain Theatre has "made it" with their production of _La bohème_. It's a scrappy [transladaptation](/transladapted-boheme-offers-fresh-intimate-production-for-national-tour/) of Puccini's 1896 smash hit, first put up in 2011 in a seedy bar and with a seedy budget; and in less than a decade, the compact indie opera group has achieved what's really rare among Canadian companies, reviving it not once but twice, and even sending the whole thing on a cross-country tour.

Arguably, AtG and its Artistic Director Joel Ivany have started a few trends in its decade of operation - or at least, given niche opera practices a bit of mainstream momentum. The two major ones: updating classic operas with a contemporary libretto in the language of the audience, and staging operas in bars.

That's part of the novelty that has hooked crowds on AtG's now-iconic _La bohème_. There's freshness in arriving at a dingy bar to hear Puccini, and the first few minutes of the show are an aural adjustment to hearing the words, "I'm fucking frozen!" sung so beautifully. This _Bohème_ offers a way in, a relevant hook for those who don't often go to the opera; it's easy to identify with these modern boho characters, who live in a world of crippling rent costs, Bloor Street West, and the 21st-century paradox that is being broke with a smartphone in your hand.

For those paying attention, Ivany's libretto only updates details, the kind that are in place to connect character with audience. If we were to strip away the hipster scarves, manscaping, and modern-day foot fetishists, we're still left with the original personalities from the libretto by Illica and Giacosa. These are young adults, making a choice to stick to their artistic guns even if it doesn't pay their bills, with camaraderie and love and optimism keeping them from getting entirely too cold.
