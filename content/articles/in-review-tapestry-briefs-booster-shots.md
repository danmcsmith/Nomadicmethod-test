Tapestry Opera is currently enjoying its [35th anniversary season](https://tapestryopera.com/), and they seem to be celebrating by putting on fantastic theatre (and a bit of food and drink). I went to see [*Tapestry Briefs: Booster Shots*](https://tapestryopera.com/boostershots) on Sunday night, the last of three performances in the Distillery Historic District. The evening was one of my best theatre experiences, hands down. Artistic Director [Michael Hidetoshi Mori](https://tapestryopera.com/michael-mori) presented selections of [original opera shorts and excerpts](https://tapestryopera.com/boostershots#program) by Canadian composers and librettists, performed by [Carla Huhtanen](http://www.carlahuhtanen.com/), [Krisztina Szabó](http://www.krisztinaszabo.com/), [Keith Klassen](http://www.keithklassen.com/) and [Alexander Dobson](http://schwalbeandpartners.com/project/alexander-dobson-baritone/), four staple singers at Tapestry Opera. Music Directors [Dr. Christopher Foley](https://learning.rcmusic.ca/glenn-gould-school/programs-and-faculty/classroom-faculty-biographies/dr-christopher-foley) and [Jennifer Tung](https://learning.rcmusic.ca/glenn-gould-school/programs-and-faculty/studio-faculty-biographies/jennifer-tung) conducted or played the excerpts on various pianos, in various spaces around the building (Foley also flexed his acting chops in _The Whisky Opera_, as Drunk Saloon Pianist, to my delight). The ease and talent that this team collectively held was so exciting to see; Toronto truly has world-class skill performing at home.
