## _Pandora_

The latest from Toronto-based FAWN Chamber Creative, the new opera-ballet sees its [world premiere run](https://fawnchambercreative.ticketleap.com/pandora/) from May 23-25 at Geary Lane (260 Geary Ave.). _Pandora_ is the product of librettist David James Brock, and composers Joseph Glaser, Kit Soden, and David Storen.

â€œAlthough this piece isn't directly about the myth," says stage director Amanda Smith, "I imagine that in _Pandora_ we see what happens when the jar, or box, is opened a second time."

## _La Lucretia_

May 23-25, New York-based Cantata Profana presents a concert anchored around Handel's "genre busting" oratorio, [_La Lucretia_](https://here.org/shows/lucretia/). "Handel was one of the greatest dramatists to ever compose for the voice. This piece is proof," says Jacob Ashworth, Artistic Director of Cantata Profana.

Sharing the programme are works spanning ten centuries, including music from the poet-composers that gave us the original _Carmina Burana_.

[_La Lucretia_](https://here.org/shows/lucretia/) runs for three performances at HERE, 145 6th Ave.
