Gregory Finney is a Toronto-based baritone, with experience as a singer, actor and dancer. He's a graduate of Acadia University in Voice Performance, Music Theatre & Dance, and he's one of Toronto's busiest singers.

Greg is a frequent contributor to Schmopera.com, and his approach comes as an unique combination of a strong theatrical background and a relatively recent introduction to opera. As an advocate for honest, organic theatre, Greg sets a high bar for opera singers who can act and move, and directors who use the music to inform their ideas. Greg has sung with Opera in Concert, Toronto Operetta Theatre, VOICEBOX: Opera in Concert, Summer Opera Lyric Theatre, Loose TEA Music Theatre, FAWN Chamber Collective, and Against the Grain Theatre. He sang the roles of Antonio and Bartolo in AtG's Dora award-winning production of *Figaro's Wedding*.
