Miss Gagnon made her opera debut in 2012, performing the title role in Purcell’s *Dido and Aeneas* (York University).  Since April 2011, she has performed roles such as Mère Marie de *l’Incarnation* (Université de Montréal and Opera NUOVA), Stéphano (Opéra Immédiat), Prince Charmant (Opera NUOVA), Zita (Université de Montréal) and Concepcion (Stu&Jess Productions), as well as several recitals and sacred music concerts in Toronto, Montreal and the Eastern Townships.

The creation of Opéra 101, a comedic operatic concert, has won Gagnon an award from Kaleidoscope foundation, and provided several performance opportunities from Quartier des spectacles, Ville de Montréal and SAMS (Société pour les Arts en Milieu de Santé).
