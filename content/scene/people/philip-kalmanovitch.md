A recent alumnus of the Atelier lyrique de l'Opéra de Montréal, Canadian baritone Philip Kalmanovitch is quickly establishing himself across North America with his exciting voice and dynamic stage presence. The 2012-13 season sees Philip make his debut with the Orchestre Symphonique de Montréal with Kent Nagano, return to the Opéra de Montréal and Chorus Niagara, and tour throughout Québec and Ontario with Jeunesses Musicales Canada. He recently made his American debut as Schaunard in *La Bohème* with the Green Mountain Opera Festival and was Don Giovanni at the Banff Centre for the Arts. At the Opéra de Montréal his performances of Antonio in *Le nozze di Figaro* and the Secret Police Agent in *The Consul* were lauded by Opera, and his effervescent portrayal of Wagner in *Faust* was singled out by critics. He also appeared in Verdi's *Rigoletto* (Conte Ceprano), Donizetti's *Roberto Devereux* (Il familiare), Puccini's *La Bohème* (Sergente), and Bizet's *Docteur Miracle* (Le podestat). Other roles in his repertoire incude Junius in *The Rape of Lucretia*, Marcello in *La Bohème*, Belcore in *L'elisir d'amore*, Ben in *The Telephone*, and Ramiro in *L'Heure Espagnole*.

Active in oratorio and concert, Philip has appeared as a soloist with the Toronto Orpheus Choir, Chorus Niagara, the Annex Singers, the Virginia Tech Vocal Arts and Music Festival, The Aldeburgh Connection (Bayfield Festival of Song and Discovery Series), La choeur les voix de la montagne, VIVA Youth Choir, and The Bach Festival. He is especially proud to have premiered two oratorios in Canada: James MacMillan’s *Mass*, and Nils Lindberg’s *A Christmas Cantata*. He has been heard on CBC Radio, Radio-Canada, and Classical 96.3 FM, and seen on NBC News in Virginia. Outside of opera, Philip has appeared in dozens of plays and musicals, including his professional debut for the Thousand Islands Playhouse. He is a founding and performing member of Open Corps Theatre, a Toronto –based collaborative theatre company which produced successful runs of *Jacques Brel is Alive and Well and Living in Paris* and Stravinsky’s *A Soldier’s Tale*.

Before undertaking studies with his current voice teacher Gerald Martin Moore, Philip completed his Diploma in Operatic Performance with Honours at the University of Toronto where he studied with Jo-Anne Bentley. He also holds a B.A.H. in Drama and a B.A.Minor in Music from Queen’s University. In 2011 he received the Galaxie Musique Rising Star Award, the IVAI Silverman Scholarship, and a Canada Council for the Arts Travel Grant. Philip received an Honourable Mention from the Ottawa Choral Society New Discoveries Series in 2012. He was awarded the Prix Lyrique Allemand and the Prix Lyrique Giuseppe Verdi-Raoul Blouin from Jeunes Ambassadeurs Lyriques, of which he is a three-time laureate. Philip is an alumnus of the Banff Centre for the Arts, the International Vocal Arts Institute (Virginia, Tel Aviv, and Montreal), the Centre for Opera Studies in Italy, and the Queen of Puddings Songs and Scenes Program. He was a Sidgwick Scholar for the Toronto Orpheus Choir under the baton of Robert Cooper. Upcoming performances include a Rodgers and Hammerstein concert with Chorus Niagara, Polydorus in Berlioz's *L'enfance du Christ* with the Orchestre Symphonique de Montréal, Motor Cop in Heggie's *Dead Man Walking*, and Guglielmo in Mozart's *Così fan tutte*.
