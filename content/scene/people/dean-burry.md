	Dean Burry was born in St. John's, Newfoundland in 1972, but grew up in the small town of Gander. As both his parents' families came from small outport communities, he spent a great deal of time by the ocean and out in his father's boat. Music is in the blood of Newfoundlanders, and it was in this environment that Burry began his own artistic journey. Early piano lessons were not completely satisfying, and it wasn't until a teacher encouraged his desire for composition, at age 10, that music became a passion. Theatre was another great interest and soon he was writing plays and music for the school drama club. His first produced script, <em>Good Gods</em>, won the local drama festival in 1987.

	Following high school, Burry began studies as a saxophone major at Mount Allison University in Sackville, New Brunswick. In seeking ways to combine his love of theatre and music, he began composing operas and musicals. In his firsts three years at Mt.A, he wrote, produced and conducted three major dramatic musical works: <em>The Resurrection</em>, <em>Joe and Mary Had a Baby</em> and <em>Unto the Earth: Vignettes of a War</em>.

	 Shortly after completing composition studies at the University of Toronto, Burry began working in the box office at the Canadian Opera Company while composing incidental music for small theatrical productions. Working in the box office was the opening he needed to begin immersing himself in the Canadian opera world. Most lunches were spent upstairs in the library or chatting with the Education and Outreach Coordinator. He was able to attend rehearsals and learn a great deal about the ways to create successful opera. In 1997, Burry was hired to create and run the After-school Opera Program; a community program designed to expose children to all the elements of opera. The program has met with great success and is approaching its fifteenth season.

	 In 1998, while working as an educator with the Canadian Opera Company in Toronto, he was commissioned to write <a href="http://deanburry.squarespace.com/the-brothers-grimm/"><em>The Brothers Grimm</em></a>. The opera was a great success and was the first work to put the composer on a national stage. <em>The Brothers Grimm</em> has been seen by over 150,000 school children across Canada, the United States and Europe since 2001. In December, 2012, the Canadian Opera Company celebrated the 500<sup>th</sup> performance of the opera with a fairy tale festival called GrimmFest. The performance coincided with the 200<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the publication of the Grimm's work. <em>The</em> <em>Brothers Grimm</em> is believed to be the most performed Canadian opera ever and possibly the most performed 21st century opera.
