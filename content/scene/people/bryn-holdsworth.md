Praised by the New York Times for her “limpid-toned, articulate” singing, young soprano and recent Manhattan School of Music graduate Bryn Holdsworth is already garnering attention on stages in New York and around the country. This season Ms. Holdworth made her Lincoln Center debut at Alice Tully Hall as the soprano soloist in Orff's *Carmina Burana* with the New York City Master Chorale. She also performed as soloist for the Oratorio Society of New York’s presentation of Mahler’s 8th Symphony under the baton of Kent Tritle. The 2016 season also included several operatic role debuts for Ms Holdsworth, including Rachel Dowling in Patience and Sarah with New York Opera Fest, Pamina in *The Magic Flute* with International Vocal Arts Outreach, and the title role in *Persée et Andromède* with the Manhattan School of Music. While studying at the Manhattan School, Ms. Holdsworth was awarded the prestigious Rodgers and Hammerstein/Richard Rodgers Scholarship as well as the ASCAP Foundation Fran Morgenstern Davis Scholarship.

In 2015, Ms. Holdsworth was seen as Norina in *Don Pasquale* with the Crested Butte Music Festival Opera Studio as well as Belinda in *Dido and Aeneas*. Other operatic credits include performances as Mimi in *La Bohème*, Micaëla in *La Tragédie de Carmen*, Gretel in *Hänsel und Gretel*, and the title role in *La Doriclea*.

Ms. Holdsworth’s training includes performing with the International Vocal Arts Institute, the Institut Canadien d’Art Vocal, and Marilyn Horne’s celebrated program, The Song Continues at Carnegie Hall. She was a National Finalist in the New York Lyric Opera competition and a National Semifinalist in both the Classical Singer and Palm Beach Opera competitions.

This season, Ms. Holdsworth can be seen at Atlanta Opera where her engagements as a Studio Artist include a return to the role of Norina in *Don Pasquale*, Madeleine in *Silent Night*, Clorinda in *La Cenerentola*, and the First Handmaiden in *Turandot*.
