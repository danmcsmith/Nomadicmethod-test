Mezzo-Soprano Eliza Bonet is of Cuban and Puerto-Rican heritage and hails from Atlanta, Georgia. Quickly gaining recognition, Ms. Bonet is currently a Young Artist with Florida Grand Opera for the 2015-2016 season where she has performed Berta in *Il barbiere di Siviglia*. She will be seen later this season in the company's production of the *The Passenger* as Krystyna.

Ms. Bonet spent the 2012/2013 season as a Resident Artist with Kentucky Opera where she sang the role of *Dorothée* in Cendrillon. She was described by www.Louisville.com as "tittering and ridiculous" and of "stealing every scene that she's in" by WFPL News. She spent the summer of 2013 as an Apprentice Artist with Des Moines Metro Opera where she covered the role of Second Maid in Strauss’ *Elektra*.
 
In the summer of 2012, Ms. Bonet performed with PORTOpera as Kate Pinkerton and covered Suzuki in their production of *Madama Butterfly* under the baton of Stephen Lord. Earlier that summer, she was a Gerdine Young Artist with Opera Theatre of St. Louis, where she covered the roles of the White Rabbit and the March Hare in the USA premiere of Unsuk Chin's *Alice in Wonderland*.
 
Ms. Bonet made her professional operatic debut as the title role in *La tragédie de Carmen* as a Resident Artist with Shreveport Opera after completing her Master’s degree from Florida State University. Other roles with Shreveport Opera include Olga in *The Merry Widow*, and Kate Pinkerton/Suzuki cover in *Madama Butterfly*. She has since returned to Shreveport Opera professionally to appear as Maddalena in *Rigoletto*.
 
Ms. Bonet has recently joined Pensacola Opera to perform the roles of Mercédès while covering the title role in *Carmen*, Tisbe while covering Angelina in *La Cenerentola*, and Dorabella in the AIR’s showcase of *Cosí fan tutte*.
 
Ms. Bonet is a versatile performer and is just as comfortable on the concert stage as she is on the operatic stage. Solo concert work includes several performances of Bernstein’s *Chichester Psalms*, Mozart’s *Requiem*, Händel’s *Messiah*, and *Ruth* by Isaac Van Grove.
