Twice named one of CBC Top 30 Canadian Classical Artists under 30, Italian-Canadian soprano Aviva Fortunata has been praised as being “blessed with a gorgeous voice of richness and amplitude.” As Leonore in Pacific Opera Victoria’s production of Beethoven’s _Fidelio_ this season, Ms. Fortunata “unleashed a rich and powerful voice” and was hailed as “retaining beauty and suppleness throughout the rest of the difficult opera, soaring to the rafters when required.” As Countess Almaviva in Mozart’s _Le nozze di Figaro_ with the Canadian Opera Company Ensemble, Ms. Fortunata was described as a “powerful and gorgeous lirico-spinto that’s destined to go places.” Upcoming engagements include a concert performance of Elsa in Wagner’s _Lohengrin_ with the Victoria Symphony and a Gala Italian Opera Evening for the Niagara Symphony.

Recent successes include stepping in as a last-minute replacement for the title role in Norma at Dallas Opera, as well as stepping in for the roles of Dritte Norn and Gutrune in Wagner’s _Götterdämmerung_ at the Canadian Opera Company. Ms. Fortunata also appeared as Leonore in _Fidelio_ for Pacific Opera Victoria. Further credits include _Tosca_ at Opera on the Avalon, Erste Dame in _Die Zauberflöte_ for the Canadian Opera Company, and Donna Elvira in _Don Giovanni_ with Saskatoon Opera.

A graduate of the Canadian Opera Company’s Ensemble Studio, Ms. Fortunata’s main stage roles include Contessa Almaviva in _Le nozze di Figaro_, Fiordiligi in _Così fan tutte_, Helmwige in _Die Walküre_, Berta in _The Barber of Seville_, Annina in _La traviata_ and Clotilde in _Norma_. Her cover assignments for the COC have included Norma in _Norma_, Anna in _Maometto II_, Alice Ford in _Falstaff_, Donna Anna in _Don Giovanni_, and Ellen Orford in _Peter Grimes_. Other notable credits include Desdemona in _Otello_ and the Lady with a Cake Box in _Postcard from Morocco_ with San Francisco Opera’s Merola Opera Program; Donna Anna in _Don Giovanni_ with Concert Opera Group, Centre for Opera Studies in Italy and the University of Toronto; and Poulenc’s _Gloria_ with the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra.

At the Richard Bradshaw Amphitheatre – Four Seasons Centre – Ms. Fortunata performed the Canadian premiere of John Greer’s piano quintet arrangement of Richard Strauss’ _Vier letzte Lieder_; other performances for this popular lunchtime series include Olivier Messaien’s _Poèmes pour Mi_ and Benjamin Britten’s _Ekho poeta_.

Chosen as a finalist in the 2016 Operalia Competition in Guadalajara, Mexico, she performed under the baton of Maestro Plácido Domingo in the historic Teatro Degollado. Representing Canada in the 2015 BBC Cardiff Singer of the World Competition, she was a finalist for the Song Prize. Ms. Fortunata holds a master’s degree in opera from the University of Toronto.
