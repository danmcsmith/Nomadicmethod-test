Hailed by Opera News as “powerful in both voice and bearing” and particularly noted for his commanding stage presence and expressive vocalism, bass-baritone Seth Carico is distinguishing himself as an accomplished young American singer. Opera Today praised “the dynamic presence of Carico, whose ringing baritone gave much pleasure.” He effortlessly capitalizes on his dramatic training, bringing a unique sensitivity to operatic characters at disparate ends of the theatrical spectrum. The 2015-2016 season saw his return to Deutsche Oper Berlin to debut several new roles with the company, including Leporello in *Don Giovanni*, Doctor Kolenatý in *The Makropulos Affair*, the Police Commissioner in *Der Rosenkavalier*, Don Pedro in *Vasco da Gama*, and Klingsor in *Parsifal*. These roles continue to build on his robust repertoire there, which includes Figaro in *Le nozze di Figaro*, Dulcamara in *L’elisir d’amore*, Sonora in *La Fanciulla del West*, Abimélech in *Samson et Dalila*, and Kassandra in *Oresteia*, a role for which he was nominated for the 2015 German National Theater Prize, “Der Faust,” for Best Male Singer. In addition, he portrays roles in *The Rape of Lucretia*, *Tannhäuser*, *Tosca*, *Die Zauberflöte*, *Carmen*, *L’amour des trois oranges*, *Les Troyens*, and the villains in Offenbach/Champert’s *Hoffmann*. Also in the 2015-2016 season, he made his role debut as Dulcamara in *L’elisir d’amore* with Opera Saratoga. He joined the Chattanooga Symphony for a spotlight concert, Seth Carico: Chattanooga’s Own and brought his Figaro in *Le nozze di Figaro* to Utah Opera. During the 2016-2017 season, Carico will make several more important role debuts with the Deutsche Oper Berlin, including Saint-Bris in *Les Huguenots*, The Traveler, et al. in a new Graham Vick production of *Death in Venice*, Gunther in *Götterdämmerung*, and Redburn in *Billy Budd*.

The 2013-2014 season found Seth making his house and role debut with Tulsa Opera as Figaro in *Le nozze di Figaro*. In the summer of 2012, Seth joined the prestigious Merola Opera Program at San Francisco Opera Center, and in 2013, he created the role of Der Arzt in the premiere of Stephan Peiffer’s new work *Vom Ende Der Unschuld* at the Deutscher Evangelischer Kirchentag in Hamburg.

Seth has appeared with Dicapo Opera Theatre in New York as King Rene in Tchaikovsky’s *Iolanta*, the Richmond Symphony as Soloist in Mendelssohn’s *Die erste Walpurgisnacht*, and the Fort Worth Opera Festival as Leonidas in Adamo’s *Lysistrata*.  For the 2010-2011 season, Mr. Carico was a Young Artist with Deutsche Oper Berlin and Teatro Regio Torino. In Torino he appeared as Roberto in Davide Livermore’s premiere production of *I vespri siciliani*, and Marquis d’Obigny in *La Traviata*. He also returned to Ash Lawn Opera to sing the title role in the classic Broadway musical *The King and I*. During the 2009-2010 season, he created the role of Victor in the world premiere of Jorge Martín’s *Before Night Falls* with Fort Worth Opera, the premiere recording of which was released in October 2010 on Albany Records.

Previous seasons have included Zuniga in *Carmen* and George Benton in Heggie’s *Dead Man Walking* with Fort Worth Opera, the Imperial Commissioner in *Madama Butterfly* with Lake George Opera, and Harašta in *The Cunning Little Vixen* and George Jones in Weill’s *Street Scene* with Chautauqua Opera.  He has previously appeared with Michigan Opera Theatre as Marquis de Brisaille in the world premiere of David DiChiera’s *Cyrano*, as well as Alessio in *La sonnambula*, and Doctor Grenvil in *La Traviata*.  He was invited to offer a recital at the University of Michigan of Dvořák’s *Cypřiše*, accompanied by renowned pianist and specialist in Czech music, Timothy Cheek.

Other featured roles include Olin Blitch in Floyd’s *Susannah*, Kecal in Smetana’s *Prodaná Nevěsta*, Don Alfonso in Mozart’s *Così fan tutte*, Seneca in Monteverdi’s *L’incoronazione di Poppea*, Colline in Puccini’s *La bohème*, Bartolo in Rossini’s *Il barbiere di Siviglia*, and Gideon March in Adamo’s *Little Women*.
