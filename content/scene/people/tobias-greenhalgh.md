American baritone Tobias Greenhalgh made his European debut last season as a member of the Junges Ensemble of the Theater an der Wien singing the title role in *Eugene Onegin*. This season he sings Ned Keene (*Peter Grimes*) under Cornelius Meister and Littore (*L’incoronazione di Poppea*) on the main stage alongside performances at the Wiener Kammeroper as Escamillo (*Carmen*) and Peter (*Hänsel und Gretel*). Previous roles in Vienna include Argante (*Rinaldo*), Ramiro (*L’heure Espagnole*), Cecco (*Gli Uccellatori*) and both Le Directeur and Le Gendarme (*Les mamelles de Tirésias*).

Back home in the US, Tobias returned as a guest artist to Palm Beach Opera last season in his debut as Schaunard (*La bohème*) having previously been a member of their young artist programme. He was also a Gerdine Young Artist at Opera Theatre of St Louis performing as Samuel (*Pirates of Penzance*) and both Leo Stein and Man Ray in the world premiere of Ricky Ian Gordon’s *27*. Appearances with Wolf Trap Opera include La Mari (*Les mamelles de Tirésias*) and Dancaïre (*Carmen*).

Described by Chicago Tribune as a “gifted and incisive young baritone,” Tobias has given recitals for Brooklyn Art Song Society (*Mörike Lieder*) and three programmes for the New York Festival of Song. Concert appearances include Bach’s *St Matthew Passion* with Soli Deo Gloria, a gala concert at Alice Tully Hall with the Opera Orchestra of New York and Vaughan Williams’ *Five Mystical Songs* with St. George’s Choral Society.

Tobias is a graduate of The Juilliard School, where his undergraduate appearances included Malatesta (*Don Pasquale*), Demetrius (*A Midsummer Night’s Dream*), Aeneas (*Dido and Aeneas*), The Voice of Pokayne in Davies’ *Komilitonen!* and Ferryman (*Curlew River*) in his final year. 

A 2015 finalist at Operalia, his past competition successes include first place winner of the 2013 Liederkranz Competition in the opera divison, grand prize in the Metropolitan International Music Festival Competition and first place in the Mario Lanza Competition amongst others. 

Additionally, Tobias is the co-creator of *Operation Superpower*, a superhero opera for children that promotes an anti-bullying stance from early school years. The opera was featured on a PBS Newshour special on entrepreneurship in the classical arts.
