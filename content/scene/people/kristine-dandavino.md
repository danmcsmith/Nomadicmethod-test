	With her "strong chest register" and "wonderful high notes" Kristine Dandavino brings "extraordinary passion" to her portrayals across the mezzo-soprano repertoire of Verdi and Wagner. "Rarely does an audience get to see and hear a performer who can match her singing with acting skills like she does. " says Sybille Forster-Rentmeister of Dandavino's "brilliantly sung" Azucena. For her Ortrud in <em>Lohengrin</em>, Ms. Dandavino was praised for having a "phenomenal voice" and "injecting her performance with the full dramatic flair of her malevolent, vindictive character".

	Ms. Dandavino also possesses the "restrained subtlety" required for her "thrilling... generous voice" to navigate the bel canto repertoire. Other performances for the 2014-2015 season include <em>La Frugola</em> in Il Tabarro with the Cathedral Bluffs Symphony, Marguerite in <em>La Damnation de Faust</em> with Opera Tunities Ottawa, a solo recital with the Off-Concert Series JMC, and appearances with the Etobicoke Philharmonic, and Opera By Request as the also soloist in Beethoven's Ninth Symphony and <em>Das Lied von der Erde</em>, respectively.
