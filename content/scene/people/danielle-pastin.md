Quoted as having “a lovely demeanor and irresistible creamy timbre” by Opera News, fast-rising, young American soprano Danielle Pastin is quickly gaining attention from opera houses around the country. This season, Ms. Pastin performs in *Madama Butterfly* as Cio-Cio San with Northern Lights Music Festival, in *La traviata* as Violetta with Pittsburgh Opera, in *Turandot* as Liú with Virginia Opera, and in *Three Way* (as Connie in “Masquerade” and Maya in “The Companion”) with Nashville Opera and at BAM. In concert she will sing Beethoven’s Symphony No. 9 at Asheville Symphony’s New Year’s Eve concert and Ginastera’s *Cantata Para Magica* at Rowan University. Recently, Ms. Pastin has performed around her country, with roles such as Desdemona in *Otello* at Pittsburgh Opera and Dayton Opera, Donna Anna in *Don Giovanni* at Austin Lyric Opera, Rosalinde in *Die Fledermaus* with Opera Naples, Liú in *Turandot* at Nashville Opera, Fiordiligi in *Cosí fan tutte* at Pittsburgh Opera, Hannah in *The Merry Widow* at Pensacola Opera, and Masha in the world première of Ben Moore’s new opera *Enemies, A Love Story* at Palm Beach Opera. She also recently sang a Gala Concert with Macau-Beijing Festival in China.

She made her main-stage Metropolitan Opera début singing Masha and covering Chloë in *The Queen of Spades* and has been invited back several times since, covering the role of Javotte in a new production of Massenet’s *Manon*, covering Samaritana in *Francesca da Rimini*, and, most recently, singing Frasquita in *Carmen*, a role she also performed in her début with the Dallas Opera.

She triumphed in her Santa Fe Opera début, stepping in as Mimì in *La bohème* under the direction of Maestro Leo Vordoni on just a few hours’ notice and subsequently received their Judith Raskin Memorial Award for Singers. She has since performed the role to international critical acclaim in venues such as The Royal Albert Hall in London, Manitoba Opera, Arizona Opera, Nashville Opera, and most recently with Syracuse Opera. Other recent highlights include performing the role of Gazardiel in the world première of *Free Will* with the Savonlinna Opera Festival in her European début, Nedda in *Pagliacci* with Austin Lyric Opera, Violetta in *La traviata* and the Countess in *Le nozze di Figaro* with Syracuse Opera, Micaëla in *Carmen* at Fresno Grand Opera, Northern Lights Music Festival, and Finger Lakes Opera, and Giulietta in Bellini’s *I Capuleti e i Montecchi* at Annapolis Opera.

Also recognized for her recital and concert performances, Ms. Pastin made her Pittsburgh Symphony début singing Juliet in Tchaikovsky’s rarely performed *Romeo and Juliet*. She also débuted with the Erie Philharmonic Orchestra as the soprano soloist in Verdi’s *Requiem*, and returned soon after for Barber’s *Knoxville: Summer of 1915*. Last season, she performed as a distinguished alumna at a concert with The Pittsburgh Concert Society.

As a first-year Apprentice Artist with Santa Fe Opera, she was featured as Nedda in a scene from Leoncavallo’s *Pagliacci*, and upon returning to Santa Fe for a second year performed as the title character in the famous Saint-Sulpice scene from Massenet’s *Manon*. As a Resident Artist at Pittsburgh Opera, Ms. Pastin delighted audiences in her main-stage début in the East Coast première of Ricky Ian Gordon’s epic opera, *The Grapes of Wrath* as Rosasharn, then returned as Female Chorus in *The Rape of Lucretia*, as Mimì in *La bohème*, and as Contessa Almaviva in *Le nozze di Figaro*. Ms. Pastin was also a Resident Artist at the Intermezzo Opera Festival Training Program, and an Apprentice Artist at Central City Opera in Colorado, where she received the Fine Arts Fellowship and performed the role of Lucinda in the world première of Henry Mollicone’s *Gabriel’s Daughter*.

In 2011, Danielle was named a Sullivan Foundation Award winner, and in 2012 she won Second Place in The Gerda Lissner Foundation International Vocal Competition and won the Opera Index Vocal Competition.
