	Andrew was a finalist in the 2010 Lotte Lenya Competition in New York, and covered the role of Phillipe in the North American premiere of Rufus Wainwright's <em>Prima Donna</em> with Toronto's Luminato Festival. As an inaugural member of Calgary Opera's Emerging Artist Development Program, Andrew performed the roles of L'Horloge Comtoise in <em>L'Enfant et les Sortilèges</em> and Stephen Wagman in the world premiere of Estacio's Frobisher. Andrew has presented compelling performances of Brahms' <em>German Requiem</em> (Barrie's Colours of Music Festival), <em>Carmina Burana</em> (Indian River Festival, PEI) and Vaughan William's <em>Dona Nobis Pacem</em> with Kitchener Waterloo's Grand Philharmonic Choir.
