Mezzo-soprano Daniela Mack has been acclaimed for her “caramel timbre, flickering vibrato, and crisp articulation” (*Opernwelt*) as she “hurls fast notes like a Teresa Berganza or a Frederica von Stade” (*San Francisco Chronicle*). 

In the 2016-2017 season, Daniela Mack makes her Royal Opera House-Covent Garden debut as Rosina in *Il barbiere di Siviglia* with Javier Camerena and her Metropolitan Opera debut in Mary Zimmerman’s new production of *Rusalka* as the Kitchen Boy. She debuts with the New York Philharmonic in Beethoven’s *Ninth Symphony* under Alan Gilbert and the Cincinnati Symphony in Beethoven’s *Missa solemnis*. Ms. Mack also returns to Arizona Opera as Angelina in *La Cenerentola* and Santa Fe Opera as Bradamante in David Alden’s production *Alcina* conducted by Harry Bicket.

Daniela Mack returned to the San Francisco Opera to reprise her performances as Rosina in *Il barbiere di Siviglia* and created the role of Jacqueline Kennedy in the world premiere of David T. Little and Royce Vavrek’s *JFK* at the Fort Worth Opera in the 2015-2106 season. She also made her Arizona Opera debut in the title role of *Carmen* and was seen in recital with tenor Alek Shrader at the Tucson Desert Song Festival. On the concert stage, Ms. Mack debuted with three orchestras under Charles Dutoit: Orchestra de la Suisse Romande in Ravel’s *L’heure espagnole* and *L’enfant et les sortilèges*, Boston Symphony Orchestra in *L’heure espagnole*, and Chicago Symphony Orchestra in Falla’s *Three-Cornered Hat*. She also debuted with the Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk in Rossini’s *Giovanna d’Arco* under James Gaffigan and performed Vivaldi’s *Judith* triumphans with Boston Baroque.

Recently, Daniela Mack has been seen at San Francisco Opera as Rosmira in Handel’s *Partenope* in a production by Christopher Alden, as well as Rosina. In the summer of 2014, she made important role and company debut: the title role in *Carmen* at Santa Fe Opera in a new production by Stephen Lawless. She also debuted at the Lyric Opera of Chicago as the Kitchen Boy in David McVicar’s production of *Rusalka* conducted by Andrew Davis and returned to Madison Opera as Sister Helen Prejean in *Dead Man Walking*. She has been seen at the English National Opera in a new production of *Julius Caesar* as Sesto under Christian Curnyn, the first time the opera was produced at the ENO since the legendary 1979 production. She also debuted at Théâtre du Capitole in Toulouse and Los Angeles Opera as Nancy in *Albert Herring*, Washington National Opera as the Madrigal Singer in *Manon Lescaut*, Deutsche Oper Berlin and Verbier Festival as Cherubino in *Le nozze di Figaro*, Opéra National de Bordeaux as Angelina in *L’italiana in Algeri*, and Opera Colorado in Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's famous production of *La Cenerentola* directed by Grischa Asagaroff.
