Canadian soprano Ambur Braid is quickly establishing herself as an artist to watch and can “deliver the trifecta of crystalline high notes, blissfully graceful vocal cadenzas and deep emotional intensity” in the dramatic coloratura soprano roles she portrays (Toronto Star).

In the 2016-2017 season, Ambur Braid returns to the Canadian Opera Company as the Queen of the Night in *Die Zauberflöte* conducted by Bernard Labadie and Dalinda in Richard Jones’s production of *Ariodante* conducted by Johannes Debus. She also makes her German debut as the Queen of the Night at Oper Frankfurt. Ms. Braid recently made her UK debut as a formidable Queen of the Night in Simon McBurney's production of *The Magic Flute* at the English National Opera, a role she also sang for Calgary Opera. She debuted at Teatro de São Carlos in Lisbon as Anne Truelove in a new production of *The Rake's Progress* conducted by Joana Carneiro.

Ms. Braid debuted the role of Konstanze in *Die Entführung aus dem Serail* at Opéra Atelier and Violetta in *La traviata* at Arizona Opera in recent seasons. She has covered the role of Elisabetta in Donizetti’s *Roberto Devereux* and the title role in *Semele* at the Canadian Opera Company. In her final season as a member of the ensemble at the Canadian Opera Company, Ms. Braid was seen in Christopher Alden’s new production of *Die Fledermaus* as Adele in which the Toronto Star called her “sexy, sparky, sensational.” and performed the role of Vitellia in the Ensemble Studio performance of *La clemenza di Tito*. 

Other recent performances include the role of Stella in *Les contes d’Hoffmann* and she sang the title role in Handel’s *Semele* in the COC Ensemble Studio performance. She covered the role of Clémence in Kaija Saariaho’s *L’amour de loin* at the Canadian Opera Company and sang Queen of the Night in *Die Zauberflöte* at Opéra Atelier. Other recent appearances with the Canadian Opera Company include Amore in *Orfeo ed Euridice*, The Greek Woman in *Iphigénie en Tauride*, and the Danish Lady in *Death in Venice*. 

Ms. Braid received degrees from the Glenn Gould School of the Royal Conservatory of Music and San Francisco Conservatory of Music. Her awards include the East Bay Opera Competition, San Francisco Conservatory Concerto Competition, and Palm Beach Opera Competition.
