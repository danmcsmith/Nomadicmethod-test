Praised by reviewers as “luminous” (*La Scena Musicale*) and “mesmerizing” (*Weisensel*), Rebecca Woodmass is a coloratura soprano who specializes in new music and extended vocal and physical techniques. Since having recently completed nine years of vocal training, Rebecca has been in demand as an accomplished and passionate performer of new opera, concert, and chamber music.

Recently described by composer Jason Noble as “a true gift to composers,” possessing an “astonishingly beautiful, agile and powerful voice,” Rebecca has premiered works by composers including Pierre Michaud, Scott Shell, Kota Nakamura, Christa Marie Emerson, Mauro Lanza, and Hunter Long. As part of the Opera America conference in Montreal, she recently collaborated with contemporary opera company Chants Libres to premiere the role of Young Patricia in Kristin Norderval’s *The Trials of Patricia Isasa* under Pauline Vaillancourt and Cristian Gort. Other career highlights include premiering Hunter Long’s *Drawing Down the Moon* (Luminary Arts, St. Louis, MO), John Tavener’s *Requiem* (North American Premier; Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra), and Pierre Michaud’s opera *Le rêve de Grégoire* (Chants Libres, Montreal). She also worked with Ensemble MusikFabrik on Claude Vivier’s lively *Hiérophanie,* performed in Canada for the first time as part of the Montreal New Music Festival.

Rebecca exhibits her stratospheric vocal range in the standard repertoire—especially in her signature role The Queen of the Night, and as Zerbinetta (*Ariadne auf Naxos*), Poppea (*L’incoronazione di Poppea*), Gretel (*Hänsel und Gretel*), and the bel canto heroines. She is equally adept in concert repertoire, such as Handel’s *Messiah*, Brahms’ *Requiem*, and Schubert’s *Shepherd on the Rock.*

Rebecca’s exceptional stagecraft benefits from training in theatre, circus, yoga, and latin dance. Her interests include vocal improvisation, feminism, social justice, LGBTQ\* rights, and making opera more accessible to a diverse range of audiences. She is based in Montreal.
