Hailed as a "singer to watch" (*Musical Toronto*), Canadian baritone Clarence Frazer is earning praise for having a “silvery baritone that retains its silky texture through his entire range" (*London Free Press*) who “possesses a powerful, robust voice" (Paula Citron). His “brilliant and stalwart singing” (*Calgary Herald*) earned him praise in
The Banff Centre’s production of *Crush* – “Mr. Frazer’s acting was excellent, his singing melodious, rhetorically balanced and beautiful” (*Calgary Herald*). 

In 2016, Mr. Frazer made his debut with Pacific Opera Victoria as Figaro in *Il barbiere di Siviglia* and with Canadian Stage/Soundstreams Canada as Jean in the North American Premiere of Philippe Boesmans’ opera *Julie*.

Mr. Frazer is an alumnus of Calgary Opera’s Emerging Artists Program and Canadian Opera Company’s Ensemble Studio, where he made his mainstage role debut in 2015 as Figaro in *Il barbiere di Siviglia*. As Figaro
Mr. Frazer was “very polished,” “made for the part” (John Gilks, *Opera Ramblings*). Other COC credits include Schaunard in *La Bohème*, Guglielmo in *Così fan tutte* and Prince Yamadori in *Madama Butterfly*. 

In 2016, Clarence starred in Saskatoon Opera’s *Il barbiere di Siviglia*.
Clarence has also sung Marcello in *La Bohème*, Publio in *La clemenza di Tito*; Prince Yamadori and Imperial Commissioner in *Madama Butterfly*, Ford in *Falstaff*, Daggoo in *Moby-Dick*, Escamillo in *Carmen*, Dandini in *La Cenerentola*, and Sid in *Albert Herring*.

In 2017, Clarence sang the role of James Isbister in the Canadian Opera Company’s acclaimed production of *Louis Riel*, with further performances at National Arts Centre and L’Opera de Quebec. Highlights for the current
season include two guest appearances with Windsor Symphony, *Messiah* and Figaro in *Le Nozze di Figaro* (concert version) in 2018.

On the concert stage Mr. Frazer performed Wagner's *Wesendonck* at The Banff Centre with The Banff Centre Chamber Orchestra and Maestro Christopher Mokrzewski; Christus in Bach’s *St. John Passion* with the
Metropolitan United Church Festival Choir and Orchestra as well as Mozart’s *Requiem*; Beethoven’s Mass in C; Orff’s *Carmina Burana* and Mozart’s Coronation Mass.
