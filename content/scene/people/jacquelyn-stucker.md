Hailed by The Boston Globe as "glowing," "incandescent," and "a singing actress to be reckoned with," American soprano Jacquelyn Stucker is being recognized internationally as a versatile singer of new and interesting repertoire ranging from concert works to opera to contemporary music. 

Praised for her dark-tinged soprano with a dusky lower register, Jacquelyn will begin a two-year engagement this autumn with the Royal Opera House at Covent Garden as a Jette Parker Young Artist. She will make both her Covent Garden Debut and her Bayerische Staatsoper debut as Azema in David Alden's new production of *Semiramide*. She will also perform as Frasquita in Barrie Kosky’s production of *Carmen* and the production will be broadcast worldwide in March 2018 as part of the Royal Opera House’s Live Cinema Season. She will also be featured in recital through the Royal Opera House: a solo recital of European premieres of music by John Harbison and Mark Kilstofte, and a staged recital with baritone Dominic Sedgwick and pianist David Gowland of Wolf’s *Italienisches Liederbuch*. 

Highlights of Jacquelyn’s 2016/2017 season included the soprano solos in Beethoven’s *Missa Solemnis* with Maestro John Nelson and the National Symphony Orchestra of Costa Rica, Beethoven’s *Ah! perfido!* with Grand Harmonie, the soprano solos in works by Graupner and Bach with the Handel and Haydn Society and Maestro Ian Watson, the roles of Gabriel and Eve in *Die Schöpfung* with the Back Bay Chorale and Maestro Scott Allen Jarrett, the soprano solos in Tippett’s *A Child of Our Time* with Maestro Andrew Clark and the Harvard Choruses, and her Santa Fe Opera principal artist debut as Oberto in *Alcina* with Maestro Harry Bicket. 

Also at the Santa Fe Opera in 2017, Jacquelyn covered the role of Rosalinde in *Die Fledermaus*. In addition to singing in the premiere performance of James Kallembach’s sacred cantata *The Most Sacred Body of Jesus*, Jacquelyn is the soprano soloist for a commercial recording of the work, scheduled for release in the autumn of 2017. 

In addition to frequently performing as a soloist throughout the season with the Handel and Haydn Society, Jacquelyn was featured as the 2016/2017 soprano in the Society’s Educational Outreach Quartet. She is also the recipient of the 2016 Anna Case MacKay Career Advancement Grant from the Santa Fe Opera, asemi-finalist in the 2016 Young Concert Artists International Auditions, and a National Semi-Finalist in the 2017 Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions. 2015/2016 performances included solo cantata BWV 199 at Boston’s King's Chapel, the soprano solos in the Poulenc *Stabat Mater* and *St. Matthew Passion* with Mo.

Jacquelyn was also recently named the 2015 Ruth Freehof Award winner, as well as a finalist of the Metropolitan Opera National Council’s New England Region auditions, and she originated the role of Meridian in the premiere of Joe Illick and Andrea Fellows Walter’s *UnShakeable* with the Santa Fe Opera. In the summer of 2015 at the Santa Fe Opera, Jacquelyn covered American soprano Ailyn Pérez as Juliette in Gounod’s *Roméo et Juliette*, as well as the Italian Singer in Strauss’s *Capriccio*.

Jarrett, Jacquelyn performed as the Soprano II soloist in Mozart’s Mass in C Minor with Boston’s Back Bay Chorale and made her solo debut with the Handel and Haydn Society as the soprano soloist in Bach’s *Weihnachts Oratorium IV*. Jacquelyn spent the summer as a member of the Santa Fe Opera’s Apprentice Artist Program, where she covered Isabel Leonard as Ada in the world premiere of *Cold Mountain*. An enthusiastic performer of oratorio, chamber, and concert repertoire, Jacquelyn is the Docia Goodwin Franklin Third Place Award winner of the 2015 Lyndon Woodside New York Oratorio Society Competition, and she performed Schoenberg’s *Pierrot Lunaire* and Ligeti’s *Aventures* in Boston’s Jordan Hall with John Heiss conducting. 

Noted as a ͞potentially major talent,͟ other representative operatic credits include Donna Elvira in *Don Giovanni* and Marie in selected scenes from *Wozzeck*.

She also is a translator, and has prepared a translation and phonetic transcription of Alban Berg’s *Wozzeck*, which will be commercially available in the coming year.
