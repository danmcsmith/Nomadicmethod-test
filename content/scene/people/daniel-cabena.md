Canadian countertenor Daniel Cabena is highly regarded in both Canada and Europe for prize-winning performances ranging from baroque to contemporary repertoire.
 
Daniel holds an Honours Bachelor of Music from Wilfrid Laurier University and a Doctorate of Music from l’Université de Montréal. He was the 2012 recipient of the Virginia Parker Prize by the Canada Council for the Arts and recently completed a Master in Specialized Early Music Performance at the Schola Cantorum Basiliensis.
 
European engagements for this exceptional artist include performances with Musica Fiorita, Ensemble La Morra, Ensemble Diapsalma, Le Concert Spirituel, and at the Schlossmediale Festival.
 
In Canada, Daniel has appeared with the Guelph Chamber Choir and Nota Bene Period Orchestra, and Scaramella, as well as with pianist Stephen Runge, in a tour of “A Sanctuary in Song,” a recital program of 20th Century English and Canadian song, which they premièred on CBC radio in 2013.
 
In the summer of 2015, Daniel is a guest soloist with l’Orchestre de la Francophonie in the première of *L’horreur de constater qu’on nous oubliera*, a song cycle for countertenor and orchestra by Stacey Brown on texts by librettist Bertrand Laverdure.
 
Next season, Daniel looks forward to his debut with Newfoundland Symphony in Handel’s *Messiah*, and L’Opera de Montreal’s production of *Les Feluettes* in 2016.
 
Daniel Cabena appears on recordings on the Analekta, ATMA, Chestnut Hall, Dorian, Deutsche-Grammophon, Naxos, and URSH labels.
