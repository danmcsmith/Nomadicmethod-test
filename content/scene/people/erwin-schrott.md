Erwin Schrott is one of the most fascinating singers of our time and is generally regarded as the best interpreter of the great Mozart plays Don Giovanni, Leporello and Figaro.

Erwin Schrott was born in Montevideo (Uruguay) and at the age of 22 he had his first operatic appearance as a rocker in *Andrea Chénier*. After winning the first prize at Plácido Domingo's "Operalia" Song Competition in 1998, his meteoric rise to international fame began: scrap debuted in rapid succession at a large opera house after another. He celebrated triumphs at Milan's La Scala, Metropolitan Opera in New York, Opéra National de Paris, Washington National Opera, Vienna State Opera, Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires, Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, Maggio Musicale Fiorentino, the Hamburg State Opera, the Théâtre Royal de la Monnaie in Brussels, the Teatro Carlo Felice in Genoa and the Los Angeles Opera, just to name a few.

In the past seasons, he sang Don Giovanni at the Covent Garden, Milan's Scala, the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino, the opera houses in Washington and Los Angeles, Seville and Turin, and a tour of Japan with the Metropolitan Opera. As Figaro, he was to be heard at the Metropolitan Opera, the Vienna State Opera, the Zurich Opera House, the Covent Garden and Valencia. Other roles in his repertoire include Pagano in Verdis *I Lombardi*, the title part in Verdis *Attila*, Banquo in *Macbeth*, Escarmillo in *Carmen*, Méphistophélès in Gounod's *Faust* and the title role in Boitos *Mefistofele*.

Among his commitments in 2011 were *L'elisir d'amore* at the Palau de la Reina Sofía in Valencia and *Le nozze di Figaro* at the Opéra National de Paris. In the summer of 2011, Erwin Schrott was a Leporello and in the title role of *Le nozze di Figaro* in Salzburg. In July and August of the year, he shared with Anna Netrebko and Jonas Kaufmann the audience at the three big concerts in Germany and Austria, as well as millions of viewers in over twenty countries, who watched the transfer from the Berlin forest stage on television.

The year 2012 began Erwin Schrott with a concert series on the side of Anna Netrebko in Germany and Switzerland, which is continued in the summer. At the Royal Opera House, Erwin Schrott was to be heard in February as Don Giovanni. In June 2012, Erwin Schrott, Anna Netrebko and Jonas Kaufman will once again meet twice at the "Summit of the Stars" and give a concert entitled "Opera's greatest Stars" at the Royal Albert Hall in London. In addition, Erwin Schrott can be heard in the *Don Giovanni* production under Daniel Barenboim at the Berlin Staatsoper.
