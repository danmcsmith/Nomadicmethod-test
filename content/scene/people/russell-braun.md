	<b>RECORDINGS</b>
</p>
<p>
	Russell's extensive discography includes the GRAMMY-nominated Mahler's <i>Das Lied von der Erde</i> (Dorian), his highly acclaimed and JUNO-nominated recording of Schubert's <i>Die Winterreise</i> with pianist Carolyn Maule and the 2007 JUNO-award-winning recording of Mozart arias with tenor Michael Schade and soprano Isabel Bayrakdarian, both on the CBC Records label. <i>Winterreise</i> quickly made its mark among a revered set of recordings of the famous song-cyle - <i>"[it] goes up against this formidable competition [Fischer-Dieskau and Goerne], as well an estimable Winterreise by Braun's late father, Victor. Braun fils's effort emerges with considerable credit...a mellifluous, musical and strongly felt interpretation." (Opera News)</i>
