Hailed by Broadway World as "every bit the heldentenor that Siegfried demands," young tenor Clay Hilley is already in demand internationally for German, Czech, Italian, and French heroes.

*The New York Times* reviewed his recent portrayal of Dvořák's Dimitrij, "The role is a daunting challenge for a heroic tenor. Clay Hilley brought vocal heft, clarion sound and stamina to the role." *Opera News* opined: "Tenor Clay Hilley...communicated Dimitrij's sincerity and sang the beleaguered leader's difficult, high-lying music with musical skill, emotional investment and attractive tone quality. Hilley's Wagnerian potential extends to clear suitability for several Slavic roles."

The *St. Louis Post-Dispatch* said of his Siegfried, "...if tenor Clay Hilley approaches his career intelligently, he’ll be playing the young hero for years to come... It’s a voice with beauty, size and heft, and the high tessitura appeared to be no problem for him."

In 2017/2018 Hilley joins the roster of The Metropolitan Opera, covering the title role in *Parsifal*;  San Francisco Opera, covering Calaf (*Turandot*), Siegmund (*Die Walküre*), Siegfried (*Siegfried*), and Siegfried (*Götterdämmerung*); and The Dallas Opera, covering Samson (*Samson et Dalila*).

On only forty-eight hours’ notice in November 2017, Clay took on — for the first time, and with only one single rehearsal — the tenor solos in Mahler’s *Das Lied von der Erde* for The Apollo Orchestra in Washington D.C.  

In January of 2018 the Wagner Society of New York presents Clay in recital, singing a program of Mahler, Janáček, Mozart, Dvořák, and Wagner.  This Society awarded Hilley its Top Prize, the Robert Lauch Award, in 2015.

In future seasons Hilley returns to San Francisco Opera; he also joins for the first time the roster of the Lyric Opera of Chicago. 

The 2016/2017 season took Clay to Virginia Opera (Canio, *Pagliacci*), Austin Lyric Opera (Erik, *The Flying Dutchman*), Bard Summerscape (Dimitrij), Washington National Opera (Father Grenville, *Dead Man Walking*), and Opera Project Columbus (Luigi, *Il tabarro*).  Hilley also flew to Salzburg on three days’ notice to relieve an ailing tenor colleague in a production of *Idomeneo* for the Salzburger Landestheater.

Other highlights from recent seasons include *Siegfried* (covering the title role for the Canadian Opera Company), Siegfried (*Götterdämmerung*), Radamés (*Aïda*), and Florestan (*Fidelio*). 

On the concert stage, Clay has appeared at Carnegie Hall as Gundelfingen in Strauss's *Feuersnot*, and as tenor soloist for Mahler's Symphony no. 8.  He debuted at Lincoln Center in 2013 as tenor soloist for Verdi's *Requiem*.

A native of Georgia, he received the Bachelor of Music degree in Music Education at the University of Georgia, the Master of Music degree in Vocal Performance from Georgia State University, a Professional Studies Certificate from the Manhattan School of Music, and a Performer's Certificate from the Opera Institute at Boston University.
