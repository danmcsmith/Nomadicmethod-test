Countertenor Siman Chung, a native of Busan, South Korea, looks toward a number of important engagements in the 2017-2018 season as his career continues to grow.

This fall, Mr. Chung joins the roster of the Metropolitan Opera to cover a leading role in the company premiere of Thomas Adès’s *The Exterminating Angel*. And in Spring 2018, he will make a role and company debut with Opera Columbus -- the title role of *Orphée*, in the Berlioz version of Gluck’s *Orphée et Eurydice*. This same production of *Orphée* will then be seen in Toronto.

In Spring 2017, Mr. Chung returned to Korea National Opera in the role of Grifone in Vivaldi's *Orlando finto pazzo*, which he had first performed there in 2016, earning critical praise for his “voice of power and emotion...suggesting readiness for even larger countertenor assignments internationally.”

The 2016-2017 season also saw Mr. Chung’s NY recital debut, presented by Opera Index in March as their Emerging Artist in a program of selections by Händel, Mozart, Brahms, Chausson, and Quilter; the recital followed upon Mr. Chung’s being awarded Opera Index's Arthur E. Walter Memorial Award in 2015. He was also awarded a grant winner for 2016-2017 by The Sullivan Foundation.

Mr. Chung made his Carnegie Hall debut in December 2015, singing in Händel’s *Messiah* with The Cecilia Chorus. Another recent success was in the leading role of the Refugee in Jonathan Dove’s *Flight* with Mannes Opera. He has also been heard with Mannes Opera in excerpts from *Rinaldo*, *Giulio Cesare*, and as Idamante in *Idomeneo*, during a concert evening of opera scenes. 

In Spring 2016, Mr. Chung took the first prize in the prestigious Gerda Lissner Foundation Annual International Vocal Competition. He also won the “Best Counter-Tenor Prize” in 2010 at the Francisco Viñas International Singing Competition (Barcelona), and in 2009 was cited for “Best Vocal Performance by a Young Talent” in the Alexander Girardi International Singing Competition held in Coburg, Germany.
