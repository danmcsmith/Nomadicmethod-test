American Soprano Jessica Fishenfeld returns to Palm Beach Opera for the 2016-17 Season as a Young Artist in residence, singing the roles of Mabel (*The Pirates of Penzance* family performance), Kate Pinkerton (*Madama Butterfly*), and covering Gilda (*Rigoletto*). To start the season, she makes her Long Island Opera debut as Frasquita (*Carmen*), and appears in concert with the Music for Montauk Festival and the Center for Contemporary Opera. Praised for her “lovely rounded tones…delicious as Najade” (*Palm Beach ArtsPaper*) and performances that have been called “scintillating” (*South Florida Classical Review*) and “sensitive” (*Opera Canada Magazine*), last season she was heard as Frasquita, Najade (*Ariadne auf Naxos*), and Norina (*Don Pasquale* family performance).

Other recent credits include Tytania (*A Midsummer Night’s Dream*) and Annina (*La Traviata*) with the Highlands Opera Studio, Musetta (cover) in *La Bohème* with the North Shore Music Festival, a principal role in the inaugural New York reading of *2wice Upon a Birthday* at the Metropolitan Opera Guild, where she also performed the role excerpts of Zerlina (*Don Giovanni*) in Dona Vaughn’s *“Don Giovanni: Love is a Battlefield.”* In 2014, she was hailed for her “crystalline and pure” voice, “large vocal range,” and “spot on comedic timing” in the role of Susanna in *Le nozze di Figaro* with the Miami Music Festival.

On the concert stage, Fishenfeld was featured as soloist in the world premiere of Byron Wu’s *Kyrie* at Weill Recital Hall/Carnegie Hall, in concert in Florence’s *Palazzo Vecchio* as a guest of (then) Florentine mayor, Matteo Renzi for the 2012 NYU Leadership Conference, and as soloist for the 2011 Classical Singer Convention finals concert. A recent graduate of the Manhattan School of Music (where she studied with Edith Bers), she was chosen as a finalist in the school’s 2015 Ades Vocal Competition, sang the title role in *Lakmé* under the baton of Thomas Muraco, and performed the role of Zerlina in Kenneth Merrill’s production of *Don Giovanni*.

Ms. Fishenfeld received a Bachelor of Music in Classical Vocal Performance at NYU Steinhardt, where she performed the roles of Adele (*Die Fledermaus*), Thea (*Fiorello!*), Clara (*The Light in the Piazza*), and Jenny Hildebrand (*Street Scene*). Other favorite productions include *Hansel and Gretel* (Dew Fairy, Gretel cover) at Hubbard Hall Opera Theatre, and Maestro Lorin Maazel’s 2011 Castleton Festival productions: *Carmen* in concert (with Denyce Graves), Mandelssohn’s *A Midsummer Night’s Dream* (with Helen Mirren and Jeremy Irons), *Porgy and Bess* in concert, *La Bohème*, *L’enfant et les sortilèges*, and Susanna in scenes from Mozart’s *Le nozze di Figaro*.
