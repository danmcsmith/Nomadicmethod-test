Mr. Jagde sings Pinkerton (*Madama Butterfly*) in house debuts at the Teatro Massimo and Washington National Opera; and performs for the first time at the Teatro Real as Macduff (*Macbeth*) and Oper Stuttgart as Cavaradossi (*Tosca*). He and soprano Ailyn Pérez will also perform in concert, highlighting works by Verdi, Puccini, Massenet, Bernstein, and more. The event is featured as the first Mondavi Center-hosted performance at the new Anne E. Pitzer Center in Davis, CA.

In the 2015/16 season Mr. Jagde made house debuts at the Teatro San Carlo as Don José (*Carmen*), led by Zubin Mehta, Houston Grand Opera as the Prince (*Rusalka*), and Palm Beach Opera as Bacchus (*Ariadne auf Naxos*). He also returned to Minnesota Opera in his role debut as Bacchus. Jagde will sing Don José in return engagements at the Deutsche Oper Berlin and at San Francisco Opera, in the United States premiere of Calixto Bieito's thrilling production.

Mr. Jagde recently debuted at the Royal Opera House as Pinkerton and sang Cavaradossi in his first appearance at Lyric Opera of Chicago. He also gave a ‘radiant' and ‘glorious' (San Francisco Classical Voice) solo recital debut at the Mondavi Center in Davis, CA, with pianist Craig Terry.
