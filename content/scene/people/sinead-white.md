With a deep felt commitment  to thoughtful musical performances, Irish-American soprano Sinéad White enjoys learning and performing a wide range of vocal repertoire. 

Sinéad’s past opera credits include the role of Suor Genovieffa in Puccini's *Suor Angelica* with performances in Dublin, Ireland as well as Thessaloniki, Greece with the Dublin Opera Summer Studio. She sung the role of Zerlina in *Don Giovanni* with the ViVace Summer Opera Workshop in Vancouver, Canada. During her time in Opera McGill, she performed as Giulietta in  Bellini’s *I Capuleti e i Montecchi* conducted by Maestro Boris Brott. She sung Fiordiligi in the McGill Opera Scenes' production of Mozart's *Così fan tutte*, the role of Venere in Monteverdi’s *L’Incoronazione di Poppea* was in the chorus *Don Giovanni* and also covered the roles of Pamina in *Die Zauberflöte* and Armida in Handel’s *Rinaldo*.

On the concert stage, Sinéad has performed many baroque favourites as well as lesser known gems with the Cozily Baroque Concert Series in Vancouver which she created with fellow soprano, Charlotte Herst. She has performed as the Soprano Soloist in Handel’s *Messiah* Sing-Along at Christ Church Cathedral in Montréal conducted by Patrick Wedd. She was also the Featured Artist at the Celebration of Christmas Concert with the Chilliwack Metropolitan Opera where she performed works by Handel and Mozart. Sinéad also looks forward to future engagements including a performance of Pergolesi’s Stabat Mater with countertenor, Shane Hanson and a small baroque ensemble in Vancouver this spring and a fellowship with the Toronto Music Festival’s Art of Song academy this summer. 

While living in Montréal, Sinéad was the Voice Category winner of the McGill Concerto Competition and was also a recipient of the McGill Graduate Excellence Scholarship. She placed first in the Voice Category in the Concours de la Chœur de la Montagne as well as a Top 5 Prizewinner in the Concours du Festival de Musique du Royaume. She was also a selected semi-finalist in the Heida Hermann’s International Voice Competition held in Fairfield, Connecticut.

During the summer of 2014, Sinéad was chosen to represent her alma mater at the Sibelius Music Academy in Santa Fe, NM where she had the opportunity to study and perform contemporary works composed by both students and professionals under the guidance of acclaimed soprano and conductor Barbara Hannigan, cellist Anssi Karttunen and composer Magnus Lindberg. Her other studies include the Canadian Vocal Arts Institute in Montreal where she worked with renowned teachers and coaches on intensively preparing repertoire.

Sinéad completed both her BMus and MMus in Voice/Opera at McGill University in Montreal in the voice studio of tenor, Stefano Algieri. She is now currently based out of Vancouver, Canada where she maintains an active performing and teaching schedule while continuing her studies under the instruction of baritone, Dale Throness.
