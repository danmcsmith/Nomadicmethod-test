Canadian soprano Sydney Baedke has long been enamored with all things opera. An Alberta native, she began her vocal training at age five and has since performed in a wide variety of national & international venues sharing her passion for vocal gems both new and old. A recent University of Toronto graduate (BMus in Vocal Performance (Honours), 2017), Sydney was named an Encouragement Award recipient at the 2017 Buffalo/Toronto District Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions. In addition to her professional operatic debut as Betty for Toronto Opera in Concert’s production of Salieri’s *Falstaff* (2016), Sydney has been seen onstage as Malwina in Marschner’s *Der Vampyr*, Cunégonde in Bernstein’s *Candide*, and Lauretta in Puccini’s *Gianni Schicchi*. She has been featured in concert with a number of respected orchestras, and is an alumnus of several prestigious training programs including the Centre for Opera Studies in Italy, Opera NUOVA, Summer Lyric Opera Theatre, and the Walnut Hill School for the Arts Summer Intensive. This past summer, Sydney sang as a vocal fellow for the Aspen Music Festival, performing the role of Muffin in William Bolcom’s *A Wedding*.

Sydney also has an avid interest in the creation of contemporary music, and has enjoyed exploring new Canadian compositions including the title role in Dean Burry’s *Pandora Locker* and the creation of Eva Braun in the 2015 premiere of Andrew Ager’s *Führerbunker*. Additionally, she has had the immense pleasure of debuting Kolby Zinger-Harris’ Confessions; *2 Songs of Sylvia Plath* for soprano and string ensemble (2016), and collaborating on Kevin Mulligan’s *Desire* (set to poetry by Gwen Benaway) with the Canadian Minority Art Song Project (2017).

This summer Sydney looks forward to fellowships for both the Songfest Summer Institute in Los Angeles and the Toronto Summer Music Festival “Art of Song” Program in addition to a solo art song recital at the Toronto Arts & Letters club. When not performing, Sydney can be found doting upon her cat, Hugo Wolf, trying on shoes by John Fluevog, and obsessing over Drag Queens. In the fall of 2017, she excitedly looks forward to beginning a Masters degree in Voice Performance at the prestigious Rice University in Houston, Texas.
