Soprano Elizabeth Caballero’s performance in her signature role, Violetta in *La traviata* is touted as "animated, communicative and believable, singing with a big, facile, focused sound while making the vocal demands of the role seem easy and natural." Her dramatically compelling interpretation of Violetta led to recent engagements to perform the role for houses across the country, such as Florentine Opera, Madison Opera, Pacific Symphony, and the Orlando Philharmonic. 

She was engaged to perform the role of Musetta in Puccini’s *La bohème* for the Metropolitan Opera after grabbing the audience’s attention in the role at New York City Opera when *The New York Times* hailed Ms. Caballero as "the evening’s most show-stopping performance offering a thrilling balance of pearly tone, exacting technique and brazen physicality." She subsequently returned to The Met in their new production of *Carmen* as part of *The Metropolitan Opera: Live in HD* series. 

Recent engagements include an exciting return to Seattle Opera to sing Donna Elvira in *Don Giovanni*, a performance of *Carmina Burana* with Florida Orchestra, a chance to sing the title role in Daniel Catán’s Spanish opera *Florencia en el Amazonas* with Nashville Opera, John Rutter’s *Requiem* at Carnegie Hall, and a concert appearance as Micaëla in *Carmen* by Bizet and Previn’s *Honey and Rue* in returns to the Pacific Symphony. This season she will once again perform as Donna Elvira in *Don Giovanni* at Lyric Opera Kansas City, as Violetta in *La Traviata* at Opera Naples, as Zemfira/Nedda in *Aleko/Pagliacci* at Opera Carolina, Liù in *Turandot* at Pacific Symphony, and as the soprano soloist in Verdi’s *Requiem* in Opera Grand Rapids.

Her career continues to gain immense momentum since her European début as Magda in Puccini's operetta *La rondine* at Teatro Giuseppe Verdi in Trieste, Italy. This led to command performances at international companies including Cio-Cio San in *Madama Butterfly* at the Staatsoper Berlin, Anne Trulove in *The Rake’s Progress* with the Brazilian Symphony Orchestra, and the title role in *The Merry Widow* at Teatro Nacional Santo Domingo.

Ms. Caballero has garnered a reputation as "an intelligently responsive actress" (*Opera News*) after a string of role débuts throughout the United States: Donna Elvira in *Don Giovanni* at New York City Opera, Cio-Cio San in *Madama Butterfly* at Lyric Opera Kansas City, Alice Ford in *Falstaff* with Virginia Opera, Violetta in *La traviata* at Opera New Jersey, Donna Anna in *Don Giovanni* at Madison Opera, and a turn as Susanna in *Le nozze di Figaro* in her company début at Seattle Opera, followed by a triumphant performance as Mimì in *La bohème*. Her company début at Hawaii Opera Theatre was in a double bill of another signature role, Nedda in Leoncavallo’s *Pagliacci* and as soprano soloist in the scenic cantata, *Carmina Burana* by Carl Orff.

A house favorite at Florida Grand Opera, she dazzled audiences as Contessa Almaviva in *Le nozze di Figaro*, Liù in *Turandot*, Mimì in *La bohème*, Micaëla in *Carmen*, and Magda in *La rondine*. In 2013, she was the recipient of the 2013 Frost School of Music Distinguished Alumni Award from the University of Miami. Other favorite engagements include a return to New York City Opera in Pagliacci and La bohème; Adina in *L’elisir d’amore* at San Antonio Opera; Micaëla in Carmen and Mimì in *La bohème* at Central City Opera; a return engagement as Liù in *Turandot* for Lyric Opera Kansas City, and a reprisal of the role at Austin Lyric Opera. 

Ms. Caballero has impressed in the competition circuit, as well. She was a National Grand Finalist in The Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions, a Gerda Lissner Foundation Award Winner, winner of the New York City Opera Diva Award, finalist in the Licia Albanese Puccini Foundation, and one of Miami’s Most Influential People by the Miami New Times.
