Hailed as a “superb discovery” by Operà Magazine, Canadian soprano Jessica Strong has been praised for possessing “a powerful top, a seductive vibrato and assured coloratura” (*Opera Canada*).  
 
This season Ms. Strong will return to Oper Frankfurt as a guest artist to make two exciting role debuts. In the fall she sings the title role in Barber's *Vanessa*, and in the new year will be seen as Marta in Weinberg’s *Die Passagierin*. During the 2016/17 season, she sang with Opera Vlaanderen as Amelia in *Simon Boccanegra*, and debuted three roles with Oper Frankfurt, including Alice Ford in *Falstaff*, Lina in Verdi’s rarely performed *Stiffelio*, and Donna Anna in Mozart’s *Don Giovanni*. She was also a recipient of a 2016 Career Development Grant from the Sylva Gelber Music Foundation, and a grant from FACTOR (The Foundation Assisting Canadian Talent On Recording).

As a member of the Internationales Opernstudio of Oper Frankfurt, Ms. Strong had many successes. She made her company debut singing Amelia Grimaldi in Verdi’s *Simon Boccanegra* and sang to rave reviews of her performance as the Prima Donna Rosa in Fioravanti’s *Le Cantatrici Villane*, where critics praised her soaring high notes, brilliant coloratura, dramatic artistry and alluring stage presence. In addition, she made her Wagnerian debut as Woglinde in both *Das Rheingold* and *Götterdämmerung* and Siegrune in *Die Walküre*, appeared as one of the Sirens in the world premiere of Rolf Riehm’s *Sirenen – Bilder des Begehrens*, as Virtù/Pallade in Monteverdi’s *L’Incoronazione di Poppea*, several small roles in Puccini’s *Il Trittico*, and Elonora in Martinů’s *Tränen des Messers*.
 
Ms. Strong was very active in Frankfurt’s Oper für Kinder outreach program, which saw her perform in productions of *Der Fliegende Holländer* (Senta), *Le Nozze di Figaro* (Contessa), *Hänsel und Gretel* (Mother), and *Die Entführung aus dem Serail* (Konstanze). During her first year in the studio, she also returned to Canada to perform recitals in Winnipeg and Southern Manitoba, and made an exciting role debut as Micaëla in Bizet’s *Carmen* with Calgary Opera.

In 2013/14, Ms. Strong made her Canadian stage debut with Calgary Opera singing Rossini’s *L’Italiana in Algeri*, where she was praised for her “powerful, charismatic soprano” in her “stand out” performance as Elvira. A graduate of their Emerging Artist Program, Jessica performed Annina in *La Traviata* (Violetta cover), the title role in *Il Segreto di Susanna*, and Ginevra in Handel’s *Ariodante*. Other roles include Alice Ford in *Falstaff* and Mimi in *La Boheme* with Calgary Opera (covers); Donna Elvira in *Don Giovanni*, Gretel in *Hansel and Gretel*, Frasquita in *Carmen*, Cunegonde in *Candide*, and Clarice in *Il Mondo della Luna* at the University of Toronto; Anne Truelove in *The Rake’s Progress* and Violetta in *La Traviata* at the Music Academy of the West; Rosalinde in *Die Fledermaus* with Opera NUOVA; and Helena in Britten’s *A Midsummer Night’s Dream* at the Aspen Music Festival (cover).

Ms. Strong has appeared in concert with the St. Lawrence String Quartet, the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra, the Calgary Philharmonic Orchestra, The Calgary Festival Chorus, The Aldeburgh Connection, The Musical Offering, Canzona, and at Carnegie Halls’ Zankel Hall as a participant in ‘The Song Continues’ with Marilyn Horne and Jessye Norman. Her repertoire includes Beethoven’s Mass in C Major, Brahms’ *Deutsches Requiem*, Chausson’s *Chanson perpétuelle*, Fauré’s *Requiem*, Handel’s *The Choice of Hercules* and *The Messiah*, Mozart’s *Exsultate jubilate*, Mendelssohn’s *Elijah* and Symphony No. 2 ‘Lobgesang’, Orff’s *Carmina Burana*, and Strauss’ *Vier letzte lieder*.
 
Jessica obtained a Master of Music from the University of Toronto Opera Division, and a Bachelor of Music from the University of Manitoba. She also holds an A.R.C.T. from the Royal Conservatory of Music. She has received additional training from Calgary Opera (2011-13) the Toronto Summer Music Festival (2013), the Music Academy of the West (2012), the Aspen Music Festival (2011, 2010), St. Andrews by the Sea (2013, 2008) and Opera NUOVA (2008).
