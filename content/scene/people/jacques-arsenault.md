Acadian tenor Jacques Arsenault began his musical career as a virtuoso accordionist before discovering his vocal talents, first as a baritone. He obtained his Master of Music from the University of Alberta and a Bachelor of Music from the University of Prince Edward Island, with further studies at the Franz-Schubert-Institut in Austria.
 
Following his transition to tenor, Jacques made his professional debut in 2015, singing and dancing with gusto in the role of Pritschitsch in Edmonton Opera's *The Merry Widow*. Jacques joined the cast as Kaspar in Opera Nuova’s production of *Amahl and the Night Visitors*, and starred as Archie in *Archiebaldo*, Cowtown Opera’s raunchy operatic cabaret about the tangled romantic life of the famous comic book character.
 
Jacques sang Monostatos in *Die Zauberflöte* and Gastone in *La Traviata* for Opera on the Avalon, the Gamekeeper in *Rusalka* and Roy Johnson in *The Light in the Piazza* with Opera NUOVA, as well as Orphée in *Orphée aux enfers*, and Léon in *Signor Deluso* at the University of Alberta.
 
Concert performances include Vaughan Williams’ *Serenade to Music* with Edmonton’s Richard Eaton Singers. Upcoming concerts for Jacques include a recital as part of University of Prince Edward Island’s Recital Series.
 
In the summer of 2016, Jacques displayed his amazing step-dancing skills over the course of twenty-one performances, portraying several roles in *The Bells of Baddeck* in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia. This charming music-drama was created by Lorna MacDonald with music by Dean Burry, based on the life of Alexander Graham Bell.
 
Jacques returned as Archie in sold-out performances of Archiebaldo, presented by Calgary Opera at their 2016 “Opera in the Village” festival.
 
In 2017, Jacques sang the role of The Young Man in Miracle Theatre’s production of *The Last Romance* in Prince George, BC, and looks forward to his debut as Ambroise Lepine in *Louis Riel* (Somers) in the Canadian Opera Company’s production at the National Arts Centre, Ottawa.
