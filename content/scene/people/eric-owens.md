	Bass-baritone Eric Owens has a unique reputation as an esteemed interpreter of classic works and a champion of new music. Equally at home in orchestral, recital, and operatic performances, Mr. Owens brings his powerful poise, expansive voice, and instinctive acting faculties to stages around the world.
</p>
<p>
	Mr. Owens begins his 2014-2015 season by rejoining Sir Simon Rattle, Peter Sellars, and the Berlin Philharmonic for highly anticipated performances of Bach's <em>St. Matthew Passion</em> at the Lucerne Festival. Additional performances of the production take place at The BBC Proms festival and New York's Park Avenue Armory as part of Lincoln Center's White Light Festival. Mr. Owens opens his operatic season by returning to Lyric Opera of Chicago, where he has been appointed as their Community Ambassador, for performances of Gershwin's <em>Porgy and Bess</em> directed by Francesca Zambello. He will also appear in his title role debut of <em>Der</em> <em>fliegende</em> <em>Holländer</em> with the Washington National Opera conducted by Phillipe Auguin. Owens makes additional role debuts this season as King Philip II in Verdi's <em>Don Carlo</em> at Opera Philadelphia, Scarpia in Puccini's <em>Tosca</em> with Leonard Slatkin and the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, and the title role in Verdi's <em>Macbeth</em> at the Glimmerglass Festival where he returns as an Artist-in-Residence.

	Mr. Owens began his 2013-2014 season in Berlin, performing in Bach's <em>St. Matthew Passion</em> with the Berliner Philharmonic and Sir Simon Rattle. After mentoring the next generation of opera stars at the American Singers' Opera Project at the Kennedy Center with friend and collaborator Renée Fleming, Mr. Owens appeared as Sarastro in Mozart's <em>The Magic Flute</em> at the Metropolitan Opera. He made his role debut as Vodnik in <em>Rusalka</em> at Lyric Opera of Chicago at the start of 2014.

	Mr. Owens has created an uncommon niche for himself in the ever-growing body of contemporary opera works through his determined tackling of new and challenging roles. He received great critical acclaim for portraying the title role in the world premiere of Elliot Goldenthal's <em>Grendel</em> with the Los Angeles Opera, and again at the Lincoln Center Festival, in a production directed and designed by Julie Taymor. Mr. Owens also enjoys a close association with John Adams, for whom he performed the role of General Leslie Groves in the world premiere of <em>Doctor Atomic</em> at the San Francisco Opera, and of the Storyteller in the world premiere of <em>A Flowering Tree</em> at Peter Sellars's New Crowned Hope Festival in Vienna and later with the Los Angeles Philharmonic. <em>Doctor Atomic</em> was later recorded and received the 2012 Grammy for Best Opera Recording. Mr. Owens made his Boston Symphony Orchestra debut under the baton of David Robertson in Adams's Nativity oratorio <em>El Niño.</em><br>
