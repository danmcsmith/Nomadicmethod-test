American tenor Bryan Register has received critical acclaim for the fresh, bright timbre of his voice and strong dramatic singing. Upcoming highlights include Tristan *Tristan und Isolde* for Grange Park Opera alongside Anja Kampe, and at the Tokyo Nikikai Opera Theatre under the baton of Jesús Lopez Cobos, his debut for Frankfurt Opera as Énée *Les Troyens* and a return to Theater Kiel for Siegmund *Die Walküre*.

Recent highlights include Beethoven Symphony No.9 with the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic, Florestan *Fidelio* for Opera Omaha, Register’s first Tristan *Tristan und Isolde* for Theater Kiel, the title role *Lohengrin* at the Hong Kong Arts Festival and at the Savonlinna Opera Festival, and Florestan *Fidelio* and Drum Major at English National Opera, conducted by Edward Gardner. Previous operatic highlights also include Siegmund *Die Walküre* with the Greenwich Symphony Orchestra, Erik *Der Fliegende Holländer* Opera Roanoke, and Don José *Carmen* for Virginia Opera.

Since moving into the Wagner repertoire, Register has been sponsored by the Wagner Society of New York and the ‘Emerging Singers Program’ of the Wagner Society of Washington D.C. He was awarded second prize in the 2012 Liederkranz Vocal Competition (Wagner Division), was the winner of the 2008 Gerda Lissner, the 2006 Sullivan Foundation and the Licia Albanese/Puccini competitions and the recipient of a 2006 Grant from the Liederkranz Foundation.

Register trained at the Manhattan School of Music, receiving the Birgit Nilsson Scholarship, and at the studios of the Santa Fe Opera and Glimmerglass Opera. While at Santa Fe, he covered the roles of Tassilo *Countess Maritza*, Andres *Wozzeck*
and Dr Caius *Falstaff*. Acclaimed for his vocal versatility, Register has been engaged for many new or rarely performed works including The Soldier *Stone Soup* for Tulsa Opera, Second Bandit in the American premiere of Martinu’s *Hlas Lesa* for Gotham Opera, Sundar *The Thief of Love*, Announcer and Man Haroun and the Sea of Stories and Manno *Sacco and Vanzetti* with The New York City Opera Orchestra
