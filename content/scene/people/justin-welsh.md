The burgeoning career of British Columbia baritone Justin Welsh was given new impetus by his recent success as Crown in PORGY AND BESS with Kent Nagano conducting l’Orchestre symphonique de Montréal. Queegueg in the Canadian premiere of MOBY DICK for Calgary Opera was another career highlight, praised by the Calgary Herald’s Kenneth Delong, who noted that “Justin Welsh brings a finely drawn vocal technique to the part, his voice beautiful throughout the register. Dramatically, too, Welsh’s role was exceptionally well-realized, a major accomplishment as a singing actor.” He has also been recently heard as Marcello in LA BOHEME for l’Opéra de Montréal and Papageno in THE MAGIC FLUTE and Figaro in LE NOZZE DI FIGARO for Pacific Opera Victoria. Of particular note is Vivier’s MUSIC FÜR DAS ENDE produced by Soundstreams with upcoming performances in Toronto and at the Holland Festival in 2018. He will also be heard in Against the Grain’s project for the fall of 2017, BOUND.

A former member of the Canadian Opera Company Ensemble Studio, he was featured in Ensemble productions of SWOON (World Premiere), COSI FAN TUTTE as Guglielmo and DIE ZAUBERFLÖTE as Papageno. On the COC’s mainstage, he has appeared as Fiorello in IL BARBIERE DI SIVIGLIA, Dancaire in CARMEN and the Herald in OTELLO. Welsh is a past Fellow at Tanglewood’s Summer Institute and has appeared with Tapestry New Opera Works, in the COC’s NIGHTINGALE production in Brooklyn, toured with Jeunesses Musicales as Belcore in L’ELISIR D’AMORE and sang Slender in VOICEBOX: Opera in Concert’s presentation of Salieri’s rarely heard FALSTAFF. Further credits include MESSIAH for the Winnipeg, Victoria and Regina symphonies, Fauré’s REQUIEM with Choeur St. Laurent, MATTHÄUS PASSION with the Guelph Chamber Choir and Grand Philharmonic Choir, Beethoven’s Mass in C and Bach’s MAGNIFICAT with the Regina Philharmonic Chorus and Beethoven’s Symphony No. 9 with the Niagara Symphony.

Awards include First Place in the Kurt Weill Competition and an encouragement award from the Louis and Cristina Quilico competition. He holds a Master’s of Music Degree from the University of British Columbia and participated in young artist programmes in the Czech Republic and in Sulmona, Italy.
