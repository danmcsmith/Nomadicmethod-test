Recognised for her beautiful timbre, soprano Angel Blue's voice has been hailed for its shining, agile upper register and "smoky" middle register. A nominee in the 2015 Opera Awards, Angel is quickly establishing herself as one of the best singers in her generation, having performed in over 30 countries in the last 5 years.

Highlights of Angel's 2014-15 season include a role debut as Tosca with Opera San Jose, as well as engagements with the Leipzig Gewandausorchester, the English National Opera, the Southwest Florida Symphony Orchestra, performances throughout the season with the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra and a performance at the 2015 AIDS Gala in Berlin with the Deutsche Oper and Donald Runnicles. In addition to these Angel will also make numerous appearances as the special guest of Placido Domingo, and has performed with Alfie Boe for a Last Night of the Proms concert to coincide with Armed Forces Day. Angel also made her Royal Albert Hall debut this season as a featured guest at the "Classic FM Live" concert in April 2015. Television appearances this season include "BBC Songs of Praise" and BBC Breakfast. In 2014 she was the subject of Melvyn Bragg's "South Bank Show: Angel Blue", and in addition, was a guest judge for the "Choir of the Year Competition". She also released her first solo album "Joy Alone" with Opus Arte which reached the highest ever chart position for any Opus Arte release to date.

Successes of previous seasons have included performances as Musetta in *La Boheme* with the English National Opera, *American Lulu* (Lulu) at the Bregenz and Edinburgh Festivals and the Young Vic, London with the Opera Group and Scottish Opera, *The Rape of Lucretia* and *Tales of Hoffman* at the Theatre an der Wien, a recital with the Rosenblatt Recital Series at Wigmore Hall, performing with the Berlin Philharmonic under Simon Rattle and the Verdi *Requiem* with the Cincinnati Symphony under the baton of the late Raphael Frübeck de Burgos.

Ms Blue was a finalist in Operalia 2009, receiving 1st place in the Zarzuela competition, and 2nd place in the Opera competition. Angel was then honoured to be a part of the 17th Annual Verbier Festival in Verbier, Switzerland in July 2010. Angel received a Masters of Music degree in Opera Performance from UCLA, a Bachelors of Music from the University of Redlands, and is alumni to the prestigious Los Angeles County High school for the Arts. She is also a graduate of the Palau de les Arts Young Artist Program in Valencia, Spain and the Canadian Vocal Arts Institute, University of Montreal in Montreal, Canada.

Her talent and versatility as an artist has allowed her to not only perform in opera, but also in the contemporary world and she has shared the stage with artists such as Brian McKnight, the late Donna Summer, Ruben Studdard, Charice, Chaka Khan, Jewel, and Grammy Award winning "Hit-man" David Foster.

Angel co-founded the organisation Youth Ablaze with her siblings. With Angel’s continued involvement, Youth Ablaze mentors teenage students from ages 13-18.
