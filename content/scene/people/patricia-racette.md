Soprano Patricia Racette has appeared in the most acclaimed opera houses of the world including the Metropolitan Opera, San Francisco Opera, Lyric Opera of Chicago, Royal Opera House, La Scala, Paris Opera, Theater an der Wien and the Bayerische Staatsoper. Known as a great interpreter of Janácek and Puccini, she has gained particular acclaim for her portrayals of the title roles of *Madama Butterfly*, *Tosca*, *Jenufa*, *Kátya Kabanová*, and all three lead soprano roles in *Il Trittico*. Her performances of Madama Butterfly and *Peter Grimes* at the Metropolitan Opera were seen in movie theaters across the world as part of the The Met: Live in HD, with *Madama Butterfly* being one of the most successful broadcasts in the history of the series. Both were subsequently released on DVD.

A champion of new works, Ms. Racette has created roles in a number of world premieres. Among these many roles are Leslie Crosbie in Paul Moravec’s *The Letter* at the Santa Fe Opera, Roberta Alden in Tobias Picker’s *An American Tragedy* at the Metropolitan Opera, the title role in Tobias Picker’s *Emmeline* at the Santa Fe Opera (broadcast on PBS/Albany Records audio), Love Simpson in Carlisle Floyd’s *Cold Sassy Tree* at the Houston Grand Opera, and most recently, the title role in Tobias Picker's *Dolores Claiborne* at the San Francisco Opera.

With the release of Diva on Detour, her breakout first cabaret album, Ms., Racette officially adds the cabaret genre to her performance platform. Her cabaret show has been heard live in New York for 54 Below, the Michael Schimmel Center for the Performing Arts, the Century Club, and the Neue Gallerie; in Washington D.C.’s Birchmere Theater, San Francisco’s Venetian Room, Dallas’ Winspear Theater, and also several venues in Santa Fe, New Mexico. 

This season, Ms. Racette's many engagements include her returns to the Metropolitan Opera in the new production of *Pagliacci* and the San Francisco Opera as title role in *Susannah*, and her debuts at the Canadian Opera Company in *Madama Butterfly* and the Opera San Antonio in her first fully staged performances of the title role in Salome. 

A native of New Hampshire, Ms. Racette earned her Bachelor of Music degree from North Texas University before joining The Merola Opera Program and the Adler Fellowship at the San Francisco Opera. Among her honors are the Richard Tucker Award, the Marian Anderson Award, and most recently a 2010 Opera News Award.
