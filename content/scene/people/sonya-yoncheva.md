Of her Metropolitan Opera debut as Gilda in Verdi’s *Rigoletto* in 2013, the New York Times wrote: “… [Sonya Yoncheva] brought lovely stage presence and a sumptuous, penetrating voice to her performance. (…) Ms. Yoncheva has such vocal glamour that, almost without trying, she tapped all the teeming emotion and sensual yearning that swirl just below Gilda’s demure outer nature (…).” The soprano's wide-ranging repertoire includes Baroque as well as Mozart, Verdi and Puccini and she has rapidly become a permanent fixture on the most important stages of the world, including the Metropolitan Opera New York, the Royal Opera House Covent Garden, the Bayerische Staatsoper Munich, the Berlin and Vienna Staatsoper and the Opéra de Paris. Celebrated for her singularly beautiful voice and powerful dramatic style, Sonya Yoncheva is equally at home on the concert and recital stage.
