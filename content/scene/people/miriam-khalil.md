Praised for her stage presence and her distinctive vocal tone, Lebanese-Canadian soprano Miriam Khalil is described as being “a lush lyric with spinto overtones” (Opera Canada) and “on the road to future greatness” (Classical 96.3 FM).

Ms. Khalil returned to Glyndebourne in the summer of 2011 for one performance and to cover the role of Almirena in Handel’s RINALDO. Previously for Glyndebourne Ms. Khalil has covered the roles of Zerlina in DON GIOVANNI and Cleopatra in Handel’s GIULIO CESARE. She was enthusiastically received when she stepped in at the very last second to replace an indisposed Danielle de Niese as Cleopatra. 

Further credits include Mimi in LA BOHÈME with Opera Hamilton, and Against the Grain Theatre, Musetta in LA BOHEME with Edmonton Opera, Susanna in LE NOZZE DI FIGARO with Opera Lyra Ottawa, Empress Marie in THE BIRD SELLER and Carolina in Torroba’s LUISA FERNANDA for Toronto Operetta Theatre, Elizabeth D’Aulnières in Charles Wilson’s KAMOURASKA with Opera in Concert, Toronto, an Opera Gala with the Hamilton Philharmonic Orchestra and Opéra de Montréal, as Frasquita in CARMEN for Pacific Opera Victoria, Beethoven’s SYMPHONY NO. 9 with Symphony Nova Scotia and Raminsh’s REQUIEM with the Thunder Bay Symphony. She sang the role of the Governess in Britten’s TURN OF THE SCREW and Susanna in a clever adaptation called FIGARO’S WEDDING for Against the Grain Theatre.

Highlights of the current season include a New Year’s concert in Victoria, Haydn’s MASS TIME OF WAR with the Thunder Bay Symphony, Susanna in MARRIAGE OF FIGARO for Pacific Opera Victoria, and a recital tour of the Maritime provinces for Debut Atlantic.
A former member of the prestigious Canadian Opera Company Ensemble Studio, she sang such roles as Leah in the world premiere of James Rolfe’s SWOON, Laura in LUISA MILLER, the Confidante in ELEKTRA, and Pamina in THE MAGIC FLUTE. She has been acclaimed for her interpretations of Fata Morgana in L’AMOUR DES TROIS ORANGES, Governess in THE TURN OF THE SCREW, Micaëla in CARMEN and Dido in DIDO AND AENEAS.

A graduate of The Glenn Gould School of the Royal Conservatory of Music, Miriam holds an Artist Diploma in Voice and a Bachelor’s Degree in vocal performance from the University of Ottawa. In 2007 she won first place in the Metropolitan Opera National Council auditions for the Great Lakes Region. She is a recent member of both The Steans Institute for Young Artists at Ravinia and the Britten-Pears Young Artist Programme.

Ms Khalil is also esteemed for her concert and oratorio work. Her credits include Ravel’s SHÉHÉRAZADE, Mendelssohn’s ELIJAH, Bach’s CHRIST LAG IN TODESBANDEN, Vivaldi’s GLORIA, Requiems by Brahms and Mozart as well as Pergolesi’s and Szymanowski’s STABAT MATER.
