Acadian baritone Dion Mazerolle has earned a reputation as an interpretive artist of the highest rank. An alumnus of Atelier Lyrique de Montreal, Dion has collaborated with internationally renowned conductors and stage directors, receiving critical acclaim for his musical finesse and powerful stage presence in a wide range of opera and concert settings.
 
Career highlights for Mr. Mazerolle include The Fool in the world premiere of Le Rêve de Grégoire with Montreal’s acclaimed contemporary ensemble, Chants Libres. His 2013 debut as Lord Cecil in Britten’s *Gloriana* with Toronto’s Voicebox/Opera in Concert further established his reputation as a superb singing actor, and his powerful portrayal of the Father in Charpentier’s *Louise* created a sensation. Dion showed his gift for comedy as Dulcamara in *L’elisir d’amore*, touring Eastern Canada and displayed his darker side as the Four Villains in *Les contes d’Hoffmann* in an extensive European tour as well as with Opera-Theatre de Rimouski. As Don Alfonso, Dion was “the vocal star of the evening” of Opera York’s *Cosi fan tutte*.
 
This season, Dion debuts in Edmonton Opera’s *The Merry Widow* and stars as Ramos in the Chants Libres production of The Trials of Patricia Isasa by composer Kristin Norderval. The opera is based on the life story of the Argentine architect and human rights activist Patricia Isasa who was abducted, imprisoned and tortured at age 16 by the military junta.
 
Recent oratorio performances for Dion include *Messiah* with Lameque Baroque Festival, conducted by Ivars Taurins, and Christus in St. Matthew Passion with King’s College Chapel in Halifax under the direction of Paul Halley. Verdi’s Requiem, Orff’s Carmina Burana and Haydn’s Creation are also in Dion’s extensive concert repertoire.
 
In 2016, Dion looks forward to Bach’s Easter Oratorio with Montreal’s renowned Ensemble Caprice, led by Matthias Maute.
