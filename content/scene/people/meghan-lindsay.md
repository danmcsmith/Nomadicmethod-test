	Hailed by critics as a singer with "lovely stage presence," a "silvery tone," and "brilliantly sparkling instrument," Canadian soprano Meghan Lindsay continues to excel across many genres. Meghan began the 2014/15 season with an acclaimed performance of the title role in Handel's <em>Alcina</em>, with Opera Atelier. She continues the season as Amour in the company's spring production of the Berlioz adaption of Gluck's <em>Orfeo ed Euridice</em>. In spring 2014, Meghan made a return to the Royal Opera of the Palace of Versailles to sing Venus and Nymphe Guerriere in Lully's <em>Persée</em>. She made her company debut with the Grammy-nominated early music company, Ars Lyrica, in a recording and 'modern world' premiere of Scarlatti's <em>La Sposa dei Cantici</em>, as well as a program of Bach cantatas. Equally at home in Romantic repertoire, Meghan recently performed the role of Agathe in Opera Atelier's <em>Der Freischütz</em>, the title role in <em>Luisa Miller</em> with Opera Nova Scotia, and Mimi in La bohème with The Northern Lights Festival. Other recent credits include Donna Anna in <em>Don Giovanni</em>, Sidonie/Nymphe des Eaux in Lully's <em>Armide</em> in Toronto, Royal Opera of the Palace of Versailles and the Glimmerglass Festival. In 2015/16, Meghan will make a role debut as Giunia in Mozart's <em>Lucio Silla</em> and will reprise her role in <em>Armide</em> at The Royal Opera of the Palace of Versailles.
