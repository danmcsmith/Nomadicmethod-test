Bass-Baritone Ryan Speedo Green, a native of Suffolk, Virginia, recently completed the Lindemann Young Artist Development Program at the Metropolitan Opera. Praised by Anothony Tommasini for his “robust voice,” Ryan will join the Wiener Staatsoper as a company member in the 2014 – 2015 season member and will be featured as Sparafucile in a new production of *Rigoletto*, as well as Basilio in *Il Barbiere di Siviglia* among several other assignments. He will also appear as Rambo in the Met premier of *The Death of Klinghoffer* conducted by David Robertson.

The 2013-2014 season saw a return to the stage of the Met to sing the Bonze in *Madama Butterfly* and the Jailer in *Tosca*. The same season also saw his debut with the Boston Symphony Orchestra as Second Soldier in *Salome* under the baton of Andris Nelsons and a debut with the Philadelphia Orchestra singing Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony. Other appearances included Son Beau-Pere in a new production of Milhaud’s *Le pauvre matelot* and Zuniga in *Carmen* with the National Symphony Orchestra at Wolf Trap Opera.

Ryan made his Metropolitan Opera stage debut in the 2012-2013 season, singing the Mandarin in *Turandot* and the Second Knight in a new production of *Parsifal* with Daniele Gatti conducting. Additional operatic engagements include the Commendatore in *Don Giovanni* at The Juilliard School, Colline in *La Bohème* with Central City Opera, and Don Magnifico in *La Cenerentola* as a resident artist with Opera Colorado.

Concert work includes the bass solo in Verdi’s *Requiem* with Hartford Chorale, Mozart’s Coronation Mass with the Virginia Symphony, and Beethoven’s Symphony No.9 with the Florida Symphony and Norwalk Symphony Orchestras. Ryan was also a featured soloist in a celebration of song honoring Carlisle Floyd’s 85th Birthday with the Florida State University Department of Music, conducted by the composer.

In 2011, *New York Times* journalist Daniel Bergner wrote an article entitled “Sing for Your Life” that was published in the NY Times Magazine and focused on Ryan’s journey from a rural suburb in Virginia to the Met stage. The article has garnered interest from *Harper-Collins* publishing who plans on transforming it into a biography of Ryan’s life.

Honors and awards include National Grand Finals winner of the 2011 Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions, a 2014 George London Foundation Award, a 2014 Annenberg grant recipient, a 2014 Gerda Lissner Foundation First Prize winner, both the Richard and Sara Tucker Grants from the Richard Tucker Foundation, and a finalist in the Palm Beach Opera Competition.
