American Cecelia Hall is one of today’s most established young mezzo-sopranos. Hailed by the Financial Times for her 'easy flexibility, arresting poise and enveloping warmth', she has appeared since 2014 in leading roles at many of the world’s finest stages, including Munich’s Bayerische Staatsoper, The Santa Fe Opera, Seattle Opera, Lyric Opera of Chicago, Canadian Opera Company, Opera Philadelphia, and Oper Frankfurt, where she is a member of the ensemble.

Ms. Hall begins the 2017-18 season with a return to Opera Philadelphia, where she stars in *War Stories* (a double bill of Monteverdi's *Il combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda* and Beecher's *I Have No Stories To Tell You*) as part of the much anticipated Festival 017, for which she is featured on the cover of Opera News (August 2017). She then returns to Oper Frankfurt to debut the title role of Purcell's *Dido and Aeneas* and the leading lady in the world's first staging of Zelenka's *Il Serpente di Bronzo*. Ms. Hall will also appear in Frankfurt this season as Dorabella in *Così fan tutte*, Vlasta in *Die Passagierin*, and Wellgunde in *Das Rheingold*.

Ms. Hall joined the ensemble at Oper Frankfurt in 2016-17 and was featured as Fulvia in Gluck’s *Ezio* and Zerlina in *Don Giovanni*. She also made her Russian debut singing Komponist in *Ariadne auf Naxos* with Maestro Vladimir Jurowski and the Moscow Philharmonic Society, followed by a return to the USA to sing Cherubino in *Le Nozze di Figaro* with Opera Philadelphia and Sesto in *La Clemenza di Tito* with Opera Theatre of Saint Louis.

Ms. Hall’s 2015-16 season included performances of Dorabella in *Così Fan Tutte* with the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra, followed by recitals with the Metropolitan Opera Rising Stars Concert Series, Zerlina in *Don Giovanni* with NYC’s Venture Opera, and her role debut as Ruby Thewes in the east coast premiere of Jennifer Higdon’s *Cold Mountain* with Opera Philadelphia. Ms. Hall also returned to North Carolina Opera to sing Rosina in *Il Barbiere di Siviglia* and to Opera Theatre of Saint Louis to sing the Composer in *Ariadne on Naxos*. Her season concluded with performances of Geisha/Dhia in Mascagni’s *Iris* with Bard Summerscape and with her Mostly Mozart debut as the mezzo soloist in Mozart’s Mass in C minor and *Requiem* with Maestro Louis Langrée.

The 2014-15 season included Ms. Hall’s return to the Metropolitan Opera as Javotte in *Manon*, a debut at the Canadian Opera Company as Rosina in *Il Barbiere di Siviglia* and at the Bayerische Staatsoper as Cherubino in *Le Nozze di Figaro*, and a return to the Seattle Opera as Zerlina in *Don Giovanni*. Other highlights included a return to Carnegie Hall for the 2015 Marilyn Horne Song Celebration, a Metropolitan Opera-sponsored Mozart recital at the NJPAC and her debut at the Santa Fe Opera as Don Ramiro in *La Finta Giardiniera*.

In 2013-14, Ms. Hall debuted as Dorabella in *Così Fan Tutte* with North Carolina Opera and Zerlina in *Don Giovanni* with Opera Philadelphia, sang a Spotlight Recital with The Song Continues at Carnegie Hall, and returned to Lyric Opera of Chicago to sing Annio in *La Clemenza di Tito*. In concert, Ms. Hall appeared as the Page in *Salome* with the Philadelphia Orchestra. Over the summer, she made her Aix-en-Provence Festival debut as Zaida in Rossini’s *Il Turco in Italia*. She then sang a concert of Baroque Masterworks with La Jolla Music Society’s SummerFest, and finished the summer with the Bard Music Festival as Florinda in Schubert’s *Fierrabras*.

An alumna of the Metropolitan Opera’s Lindemann Young Artist Development Program and the Lyric Opera of Chicago’s Ryan Opera Center, Ms. Hall appeared at the Lyric Opera as Third Maid in *Elektra*, Alisa in *Lucia di Lammermoor*, and Second Lady in *Die Zauberflöte*, among other roles. She recently made debuts with the Seattle Opera as Wellgunde and Rossweisse in their 2013 *Ring des Nibelungen* and with the Fort Worth Opera as the Komponist in *Ariadne auf Naxos* (a role she previously sang with the Palau de les Arts in Valencia, Spain and at the Tanglewood Music Festival).

Ms. Hall received much critical acclaim for her performance in the title-role of Handel’s *Teseo* at Chicago Opera Theater, and she has also debuted at the Metropolitan Opera as the Second Priestess in *Iphigénie en Tauride*. At the Castleton Festival, she has appeared as Rosina in *Il Barbiere di Siviglia* and L’Enfant in Ravel’s *L’Enfant et les Sortilèges*. At Juilliard Opera she was featured as Concepción in *L’Heure Espagnole*, Nerone in *L’Incoronazione di Poppea*, Cherubino in *Le Nozze di Figaro*, and in the title role of *Ariodante*.

A noted recitalist, Cecelia Hall has appeared several times at Carnegie Hall, both with the Horne Foundation and with Carnegie’s Ensemble ACJW. As a Samling Artist, she sang in recital at Wigmore Hall.
