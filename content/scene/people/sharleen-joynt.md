“Silvery”-voiced coloratura soprano Sharleen Joynt has been “sparking audience enthusiasm” with her “special and unexpected amber timbre”, “a vocal range that is second to none”, her “scintillating stage presence”, and her “love for taking risks”. 

Sharleen’s 2013/14 Season will include rejoining the Metropolitan Opera roster to cover Fiakermilli in R. Strauss’ Arabella. She will also appear with the Badisches Staatstheater Karlsruhe, Theater und Orchester Heidelberg, Theater St. Gallen in Switzerland, and make her France debut.

For the 2012/13 Season Sharleen spent her second year as an ensemble member of the Theater und Orchester Heidelberg, performing Blonde in Die Entführung aus dem Serail and receiving critical acclaim for her “stratospheric” Soprano 1/Ariadne in Wolfgang Rihm’s Dionysos. She also made both a role and house debut with the Badisches Staatstheater Karlsruhe as Marie in La Fille du Régiment. Her uncommonly honest embodiment of characters and fearless onstage presence in German Regietheater led to a 3-page article in the May 2013 issue of Deutsche Bühne magazine.

The 2011/12 Season included joining the Theater und Orchester Heidelberg ensemble for Frasquita in Carmen and her vastly critically acclaimed Zerbinetta in Ariadne auf Naxos, the role for which she was nominated for Nachwunschsängerin (Young Singer of the Year) by Opernwelt magazine. She also debuted with the Winter in Schwetzingen Baroque Festival as Fausta in the German premiere of Scarlatti’s Marco Attilio Regolo.

Sharleen’s 2010/11 Season included joining the Metropolitan Opera roster to cover the role of Zerbinetta in Ariadne auf Naxos. She joined the Anhaltisches Theater Dessau ensemble, making her European debut as Oscar in Un Ballo in Maschera, followed by Adele in Die Fledermaus, and Despina in Cosi Fan Tutte. She also returned to the International Vocal Arts Institute in Tel Aviv to perform her frst Zerbinetta under the baton of Metropolitan Opera conductor Paul Nadler.

In 2009 Sharleen made her Carnegie Hall debut singing the soprano solo in Schubert���s Mass in G. For the 2009/10 Season she was an Emerging Artist with Calgary Opera. She graduated from Mannes College of Music in New York in 2009 with her Masters degree in Vocal Performance. She has been a prizewinner in the Liederkranz Foundation Competition, the George London Foundation Competition, the Young Concert Artists International Auditions, the Licia-Albanese Foundation Competition, the Canadian Music Competition’s International Stepping Stone, and the Palm Beach Opera Vocal Competition.
