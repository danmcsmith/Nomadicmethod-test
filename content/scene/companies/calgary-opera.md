Founded in 1972, Calgary Opera's Mission is:

"To Engage our Audience and Enhance our Community through the Magic of Opera."

Since its inception, and especially in the past decade, Calgary Opera has made a name for itself as a company that is committed to the development of Canadian talent and the development of new opera works.
