The Vlaamse Opera (Flemish Opera) is directed by Aviel Cahn, and operates in two different opera houses in two Flemish cities, the Vlaamse Opera Antwerpen and the Vlaamse Opera Ghent. 

In its current form, the company was created in 1996 as a successor to the Flemish Opera Foundation (Vlaamse Opera Stichting, which had existed since 1988), and the Opera for Flanders (Opera voor Vlaanderen, which had existed since 1981). Both former institutions were similar fusions between the former opera houses of Antwerp and Ghent. Since the fusion in 1981, the company has been giving performances in two different historic theatres.
