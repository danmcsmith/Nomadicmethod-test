Tête à Tête is a company committed to exploring the future of opera. We produce new works and find new ways of producing old works year-round. We also host dozens of other companies at our annual summer Festival. Thus Tête à Tête brings artists and audience together to explore the future of opera.
 
Tête à Tête itself has produced over 70 stage works by more than 50 different composers, for audiences throughout the UK and abroad.

In addition, for the last seven years the company has created a platform for the work of over a hundred other companies and many hundreds of artists in Tête à Tête: The Opera Festival.
