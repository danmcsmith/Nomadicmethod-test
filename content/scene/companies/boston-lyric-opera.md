Boston Lyric Opera is the largest opera company in all of New England. Now in its 39th season, BLO celebrates the art of the voice through its mission of building curiosity, enthusiasm and support for opera by creating musically and theatrically compelling productions, events, and educational resources for the Boston community and beyond. Since its founding in 1976, the company has staged world premieres, U.S. premieres, co-productions  and co-commissions of note with organizations such as The Royal Opera, Covent Garden and Scottish Opera, and continues to be a destination for some of the leading artists, conductors, directors and designers from around the world.

BLO produces four productions each season: three at the Citi Performing Arts CenterSM Shubert Theatre in Boston and the annual Opera Annex production in a found space. BLOâ€™s programs are funded, in part, by a grant from the Massachusetts Cultural Council and the National Endowment for the Arts.
