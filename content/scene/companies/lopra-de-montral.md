<p>
	Each year, some 55,000 spectators make their way through the doors at the Opéra de Montréal, the largest francophone opera company in North America. Its season is made up of four or five operas, a concert by the Atelier lyrique, a Gala, and many outreach activities. The Opéra is a key player in Montreal's economic, cultural, and social development as it maintains, season after season, working relationships with over 360 local businesses and hires over 800 artists and artisans.
