Caitleen, Megan, Steve and Florence met while completing their graduate degrees at the Eastman School of Music. Passionate about communication in performance, and art song in particular, they decided to form the Lynx Project in the summer of 2015. The goal of the Lynx Project is to bring the incredible world of art song to a wider audience through intimate and inclusive performances and an exploration of the boundaries of traditional recital form.
 
By broadening the scope and nature of art song recitals, Lynx Project seeks to expand the audience base of classical music and increase appreciation for the songs and poetry that speak timelessly to the human condition.
