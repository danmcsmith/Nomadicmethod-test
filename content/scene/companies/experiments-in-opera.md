Experiments in Opera is a composer-driven non-profit opera company that presents new works that connect words, story and music. Our mission is to support and educate composers who are exploring musical work beyond a strictly concert setting into the hybrid genre of opera. Experiments in Opera builds informed audiences that are capable of contributing to its work.

We believe composers are the visionaries of 21st Century opera, and define opera as the activity of telling stories through music. We support artists with unusual stories to tell, and embrace the diversity of their life and musical experiences. Our core programming addresses three areas of activities:

EiO supports composers through development workshops and performance opportunities driven by the composers’ ideas and direction.
EiO builds community through meaningful partnerships with ensembles, media outlets and presenting organizations.
EiO helps to share new operas developed through its programs with a broader audience through advocacy efforts including video materials, contextual writings and robust public programs.
Co-Founded in Brooklyn in 2010 by composers Aaron Siegel, Matthew Welch and Jason Cady, Experiments in Opera has commissioned 45 new works in five years, collaborating with over one hundred fifty performers, designers and directors from the New York City artists community.  During that time we have produced events at Roulette and Issue Project Room in Brooklyn, as well as at The Stone, Le Poisson Rouge, Anthology Film Archives and Abrons Arts Center in Manhattan.

Experiments in Opera has presented the work of 35 composers since our first presentation including Jason Cady, Aaron Siegel, Matthew Welch, Roddy Bottom, Gelsey Bell, Georges Aperghis, Robert Ashley, Joe Diebes, Natacha Diels, Anne Guthrie, James Ilgenfritz, John King, Daniel Kushner, Ruby Fulton, Gabrielle Herbst, Nick Hallett, Travis Just, Mary Kouyoumdjian, Lukas Ligeti, Charlie Looker, Emily Manzo, Anna Mikailhova, Jonathan Mitchell, Jascha Narveson, Jessica Pavone, Paul Pinto, Dave Ruder, Elliott Sharp, JG Thirlwell, Justin Tierney, Leaha Maria Villarreal, Dorian Wallace, Katie Young, John Zorn and the Cough Button collective.

We take seriously our role as an organizer of artist and audience communities.  To support our composers’ visions and to make the most of our audiences’ connections with our work, we prioritize sharing in-depth interviews with our artists and video documentation of all of our work in our online media library at experimentsinopera.com.  These insightful looks into the origins of artists’ ideas and their working habits help to support EIO’s mission of building a more robust conversation about how and why opera works the way it does.
