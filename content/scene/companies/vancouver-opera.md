<p>
	VO was founded in 1958 by a group of visionary community leaders who believed in the value of the performing arts to the life of a great city, and who recognized the power of opera to connect people to the universal human drama.
</p>
<p>
	VO strives to be the destination performing arts organization that entertains, stimulates and enriches British Columbians, driven by programming that redefines 'opera' and revolutionizes its accessibility and community value.
