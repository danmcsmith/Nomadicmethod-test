<p>
	Welsh National Opera transforms lives through the power of opera. We are passionate about opera and want to share this passion with as many people as possible. We do this with award winning performances of fully staged opera and concerts which combine a sense of adventure with the highest possible quality. We keep our performances accessible through affordable ticket prices. Beyond the theatre we connect with people through our community and education work and digital projects.
