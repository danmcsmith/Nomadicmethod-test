<p>
	Edmonton Opera is dedicated to producing great performances that bring the powerful emotions of opera to our community. Our purpose and vision is to present opera that moves and inspires our audiences â€” individuals, corporate organizations and the three levels of government, all who are partners and sponsors in our community. We are committed to offering high-quality education programs, so we can bring opera to the classrooms, homes and lives of Edmontonians, and contribute to the versatile culture and arts scene in our city.
</p>
<p>
	Since 1963, Edmonton Opera has given voice to opera in the community and throughout northern Alberta. We have been a home to many great singers, directors and musicians.
