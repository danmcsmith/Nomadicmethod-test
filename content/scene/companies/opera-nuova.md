<p>
	Opera NUOVA is a charitable, not-for-profit organization established in 1998, primarily as a training organization for operatic vocalists and collaborative pianists across Canada. Our focus is to bridge the gap between academia and a professional career and we have developed a reputation as one of the best training programs in the country.
</p>
<p>
	Over the last 12 years, Opera NUOVA has evolved into a two-tiered organization. We continue to provide training to emerging artists across the country but also offer the Vocal Arts Festival to the community, which is Canada's largest festival of Opera and Vocal Music.
</p>
<p>
	As a production company we focus primarily in Greater Edmonton but also tour productions to other parts of the province. A significant amount of work has been dedicated to outreach and to young audience development. Our goal has always been to offer these performances in an intimate setting at modest prices.
