<p>
	Tapestry is a professional theatre and opera producer that creates and produces for the heart of the here and now. In addition to producing a concert and chamber opera season, Tapestry has become an international crossroads for diverse musical and dramatic artists inspired to contribute to the creation and evolution of new opera. Creation begins with multiple collaborations at the Composer-Librettist Laboratory (LibLab), where eight writers and composers are introduced and produce sixteen opera shorts under intense conditions. Successful partnerships may result in commissioning new full length works by Tapestry or by other producers. Evolution exists not only in the content and style of the music and text but also in performance practice. Tapestry Explorations (Tap:Ex) is Canada's premiere program for the evolution and advancement of opera performance practice and seeks inspiration from other art forms in both art and popular streams.
