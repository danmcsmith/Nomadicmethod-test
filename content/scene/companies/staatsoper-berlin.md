The Berliner Staatsoper's permanent home is the opera house on the Unter den Linden boulevard in the Mitte district of Berlin, which also hosts the Staatskapelle Berlin orchestra. It is also known as Deutsche Staatsoper, and short as Lindenoper. From 1949 to 1990 it was the state opera of East Germany. Since 2004 the Berlin State Opera belongs like the Deutsche Oper Berlin, the Komische Oper Berlin, the Berlin State Ballet and the BÃ¼hnenservice Berlin (Stage and Costume Design) to the Berlin Opera Foundation.

Since 2009, the Berlin State Opera has been undergoing considerable renovation work led by German architect HG Merz. The roof of the opera building was raised and the proscenium prolonged to improve the acoustics. Other renovation and extension works include the director's building, the below-ground connection building and the depot building. The latter will house the new rehearsal center.
